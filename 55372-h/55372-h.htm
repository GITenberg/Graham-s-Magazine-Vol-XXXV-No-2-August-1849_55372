<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. CAROLINE H. BUTLER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Deacon.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody called Mr. Humphreys a good man.
To have found any fault with the deacon would have
been to impugn the church itself, whose most firm pillar
he stood. No one stopped to analyze his goodness—it
was enough that in all outward semblance, in the whole
putting together of the outward man, there was a conformity
of sanctity; that is, he read his Bible—held
family prayers night and morning—preached long
homilies to the young—gave in the cause of the heathen—and
was, moreover, of a grave and solemn aspect,
seldom given to the folly of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this, and more did good Deacon Humphreys;
and yet one thing he lacked, viz., the sweet spirit of
charity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mean not that he oppressed the widow, or robbed
the orphan of bread; no, not this, it was the cold unforgiving
spirit with which he looked upon the errors
of his fellow man—the iron hand with which he thrust
far from him the offender, which betrayed the want of
that charity “<span class='it'>which rejoiceth not in iniquity, suffereth
long, and is kind</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was also pertinaciously sectarian. No other path
than the one in which he walked could lead to eternal life.
No matter the sect, so that they differed from him, it
was enough—they were outlawed from the gates of
Heaven. Ah! had the deacon shared more the spirit
of our blessed Saviour, in whose name he offered
up his prayers, then, indeed, might he have been
entitled to the Christian character he professed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Humphreys partook largely of her husband’s
views. She, too, was irreproachable in her daily
walks, and her household presented a rare combination
of order and neatness. The six days work was
done, and done faithfully, and the seventh cared for, ere
the going down of the Saturday’s sun, which always
left her house in order—her rooms newly swept and
garnished—the stockings mended—the clean clothes
laid out for the Sabbath wear—while in the kitchen
pantry, a joint of cold meat, or a relay of pies, was
provided, that no hand might labor for the creature
comforts on the morrow. As the last rays of the sun
disappeared from hill and valley, the doors of the house
were closed—the blinds pulled down—the well-polished
mahogany stand drawn from its upright position in the
corner of the sitting-room, which it occupied from
Monday morning until the coming of the Saturday
night—the great family Bible placed thereon, while
with countenances of corresponding gravity, and well-balanced
spectacles, the deacon and his wife read from
its holy pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus in all those outward observances of piety,
whereon the great eyes of the great world are staring,
I have shown that the deacon and his good wife might
challenge the closest scrutiny. Nor would I be understood
to detract aught from these observances, or
throw down one stone from the altars of our Puritan
fathers. We need all the legacy they left their children.
The force of good example is as boundless as
the tares of sin—let us relax nothing which may
tend to check the evil growth—and who shall say
that the upright walk of Deacon Humphreys was
without a salutary influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is with the <span class='it'>inner</span> man we have to do. The
fairest apples are sometimes defective at the core.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Grassmere and its Inhabitants.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Grassmere was a quiet out-of-the-way village, hugged
in close by grand mountains, and watered by sparkling
rivulets and cascades, which came leaping down
the hillsides like frolicksome Naiads, and then with
a murmur as sweet as the songs of childhood, ran off
to play bo-peep with the blue heavens amid the deep
clover-fields, or through banks sprinkled with nodding
wild-flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tempting retreat was Grassmere to the weary
man of business, whose days had been passed within
the brick and mortar walks of life, and whom the
fresh air, and the green grass, and the waving woods,
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
were but as a page of delicious poetry snatched at idle
hours. Free from the turmoil and vexations of the
city, how pleasant to tread the down-hill of life, surrounded
by such peaceful influences as smiled upon
the inhabitants of Grassmere, and several beautiful
cottages nestling in the valley, or dotting the hill-side,
attested that some fortunate man of wealth had here
cast loose the burthen of the day, to repose in the quiet
of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although our story bears but slightly save upon
three or four of the three thousand inhabitants of
Grassmere, I will state that a variety of religious
opinions had for several years been gradually creeping
into this primitive town, and that where once a single
church received the inhabitants within one faith, there
were now four houses of worship, all embracing different
tenets. But the deacon walked heavenward
his own path, shaking his skirts free from all contamination
with other sects, whom, indeed, he looked
upon as little better than heathen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pastor of the church claiming so zealous a
member, was a man eminent for his Christian benevolence.
His was not the piety which exhausted
itself in words—heart and soul did he labor to do his
Master’s will, and far from embracing the rigid views
of the worthy Deacon Humphreys, he wore the garb
of charity for all, and in his great, good heart loved all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had one son, who, at the period from which my
story dates, was pursuing his collegiate course at one
of our most popular institutions, and in his own mind
the deacon had determined that Hubert Fairlie should
become the husband of his only daughter, Naomi. In
another month Hubert was to return to pass his vacation
at Grassmere, and Naomi looked forward to the
meeting with unaffected pleasure. They had been
playmates in childhood, companions in riper years;
but love had nothing to do with their regard for each
other, yet the deacon could not conceive how friendship
alone should thus unite them. At any rate Naomi
must be the wife of Hubert—that was as set as his
Sunday face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deacon was a man well off in worldly matters.
He owned the large, highly cultivated farm on which
he lived, as also several snug houses within the village,
which rented at good rates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the little cottage at Silver-Fall was untenanted.
Through the inability of its former occupant to pay
the rent, it had returned upon the hands of the deacon,
and although one of the most delightful residences for
miles around, had now been for several months without
a tenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A charming spot was Silver-Fall, with its little
dwelling half hidden by climbing roses and shadowy
maples. Smooth as velvet was the lawn, with here
and there a cluster of blue violets clinging timidly
together, and hemmed by a silvery thread of bright
laughing water, which, within a few rods of the
cottage-door, suddenly leaped over a bed of rocks some
twenty feet high, into the valley below. This gave it
the name of Silver-Fall Cottage—all too enticing a spot
it would seem to remain long unoccupied. Yet the
snows of winter yielded to the gentle breath of spring,
and the bright fruits of summer already decked the
hedge-rows and the thicket, ere a tenant could be
found, and then there came a letter to Mr. Humphreys
from a widow lady living in a distant city, requiring
the terms on which he would lease his pretty cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were favorable, it would seem, to her views,
and in due time Mrs. Norton, her daughter Grace,
and two female domestics, arrived at Silver-Fall.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>One Fold of the Curtain drawn back.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A new comer in a country village is always sure to
elicit more or less curiosity, and Mrs. Norton did not
escape without her due share from the inhabitants of
Grassmere. With telegraph speed it was found out
that she was a lady between thirty and forty years of
age, dressed in bombazine, and wore close mourning
caps. Miss Norton was talked of as a slender, fair
girl, with blue eyes, and long, flowing curls, and might
be seventeen, perhaps twenty—of course, they could
not be strictly accurate in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bales of India matting were unrolled in the door-yard—crates
of beautiful china unpacked in the piazza—sofas
and chairs crept out from their rough traveling
cases, displaying all the beauty of rosewood and
damask, until finally by aid of all these means and
appliances to boot, Mrs. Norton and her daughter
were pronounced very <span class='it'>genteel</span>—but—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, I wonder what they are!” said Mrs. Humphreys
to the deacon, as talking over these secular
matters she handed him his second cup of coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that the good lady had any doubt of their being
<span class='it'>bona fide</span> flesh and blood; neither did she believe they
were witches or fairies who had taken up their abode
at Silver-Fall. “<span class='it'>I wonder what they are!</span>” must
therefore be interpreted as “<span class='it'>I wonder what church
they attend</span>,” or “<span class='it'>what creed they profess</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deacon shook his head and looked solemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is to be hoped,” continued Mrs. Humphreys,
complacently stirring the coffee, “that at her period of
life Mrs. Norton may be a professor of some kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deacon dropped his knife and fork—he was
shocked—astounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am surprised to hear you speak thus lightly, Mrs.
Humphreys—<span class='it'>a professor of some kind</span>! Is it not
better that she should yet rest in her sins, than to be
walking in the footsteps of error—a <span class='it'>professor of some
kind</span>! Wife—wife—you forget yourself!” exclaimed
the deacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spoke thoughtlessly, I acknowledge,” answered
Mrs. Humphreys, much confused by the stern rebuke
of her husband. “I meant to say, I hoped she had
found a pardon for her sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you forgotten that you are a parent?” continued
the deacon, solemnly. “Can you suffer the
ears of your daughter to drink in such poison! <span class='it'>A professor
of some kind!</span> Naomi, my child,” placing his
hand on the sunny head before him, “beware how you
listen to such doctrine; there is but one true faith—there
is but one way by which you can be saved. Go
to your chamber, and pray you may not be led into
error through your mother’s words of folly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were others at Grassmere most anxiously
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
wondering, like good Mrs. Humphreys, “<span class='it'>what they
were</span>,” ere they so far committed themselves as to
call upon the strangers. Sunday, however, was close
at hand; Mrs. Norton’s choice of a church was to determine
them the choice of her acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the reader think the inhabitants of Grassmere
peculiar? I think not. There are very many
just such people not a hundred rods from our own
doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, on Sunday the rain poured down in
torrents. Nothing less impervious than strong cowhide
boots—India-rubber overcoats, and thick cotton
umbrellas, could go to meeting, consequently, Mrs.
Norton staid at home, and on Monday afternoon, after
the washing was done, and the deacon had turned his
well saturated hay, Mrs. Humphreys put on her best
black silk gown and mantilla, her plain straw bonnet,
with white trimmings, and walked over with her
husband to Silver-Fall cottage. As the widow rented
her house of them, they could not in decency, they
reasoned, longer defer calling upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glance within the cottage would convince any
one that Mrs. Norton and Grace were at least persons
of refinement—for there is as much character displayed
in the arrangement of a room as in the choice
of a book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cream colored mattings, and window-curtains of
transparent lace, relieved by hangings of pale sea-green
silk, imparted a look of delicious coolness to the apartments.
There was no display of gaudy furniture, as if
a cabinet warehouse had been taken on speculation—yet
there was enough for comfort and even elegance;
nor was there an over exhibition of paintings—one of
Cole’s beautiful landscapes, and a few other gems of
native talent were all; nor were the tables freighted
as the counter of a toy-shop; the only ornament of each
was a beautiful vase of Bohemian glass, filled with
fresh garden flowers, whose tasteful arrangement even
fairy hands could not have rivaled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few moments they were awaiting the entrance
of Mrs. Norton were employed by Mrs. Humphreys
in taking a rapid survey of all these surroundings, the
result of which was to impress her with a sort of awe
for the mistress of this little realm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My stars!” said she, casting her eyes to the right
and left, half rising from the luxurious couch to peep
into one corner, and almost breaking her neck to dive
into another, “my stars, deacon, if this don’t beat all
I ever did see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the deacon, with an air worthy of a funeral,
shook his head, closed his eyes, and muttered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vanity—vanity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, and Grace gliding in, sweetly
apologized for her mother, whom a violent headache
detained in her apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do wish I knew what they were!” again
exclaimed Mrs. Humphreys, as she took the deacon’s
arm and plodded thoughtfully homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then going to a dark cupboard under the stairs, she
rummaged for some time among the jars and gallipots,
and finally producing one marked “Raspberry Jam,”
she told Naomi to put on her Sunday bonnet, and carry
it to the cottage, and⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naomi, you may just as well ask Grace Norton
what meeting she goes to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delighted to make the acquaintance of Grace, Naomi
threw on her bonnet and tripped lightly to the cottage,
thinking little, we fear, of her mother’s last charge.
At any rate it was omitted, and so the night-cap of
Mrs. Humphreys again threw its broad frilling over an
unsatisfied brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <a id='morn'></a>morning the deacon received a very neat
note from Mrs. Norton, requesting to see him up on
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, my dear sir,” said she, after the common
courtesies of the day were passed, “I have taken
the liberty to send for you to transact a little business
for me. If not too great a tax upon your time, will
you purchase a pew for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deacon grimly smiled, and rubbing his knee,
replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, Mrs. Norton, I shall be glad to attend
to the matter. True, it is a busy season with us
farmers, but the Lord forbid I should therefore neglect
<span class='it'>his</span> business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you can procure me one?” asked
Mrs. Norton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, I reckon so, for I am certain there are several
pews now to be let or sold either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what price, Mr. Humphreys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess about sixty dollars; and now I recollect,
Squire Bryce wants to sell his—it is right
alongside of mine, and I reckon my pew is as good for
hearing the word as any in the meeting-house. I am
glad, really I do rejoice to find you a true believer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mistake my church, I see,” said Mrs. Norton,
smiling, “I belong to a different denomination from
the one of which as I am aware you are a professor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” cried the deacon, rising hastily and making
for the door, “excuse me—I—I know nothing of any
other church or its pews. I cannot be the instrument
of seating you where false doctrines are preached!
I—good morning, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow sighed as the gate slammed after her
visiter, but Grace burst into a merry fit of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How ridiculous!” she exclaimed; “was there
ever such absurdity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, hush my dear child,” said Mrs. Norton,
“Mr. Humphreys is without doubt perfectly conscientious
in this matter—we may pity, but not condemn
such zeal in the cause of religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you call bigotry religion, mamma?” asked
Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A person may be a very good Christian, Grace,
and yet be very much of a bigot,” answered her
mother. “That such a spirit as Mr. Humphreys has
just now shown may often be productive of more evil
than good, I allow. His aim is to do good, but he
adopts the wrong measures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, mamma, one would have judged from his
manner that we were infidels!” said Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O no, my child, he did not really think that,” replied
Mrs. Norton, smiling at her earnestness. “He
only felt shocked at what he deems our error—for he
sacredly believes there can be no safety in any other
creed than his own. Without the charity therefore
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
to think there may be good in all sects, and lacking
the desire to study the subject, or rather so much
wedded to his belief that he would deem it almost a
sin to do so, like an unjust judge, he condemns without
a hearing. There are too many such mistaken zealots
in every creed of worship. O, my dear child,” continued
Mrs. Norton, her fine eyes bathed in tears,
“would that members of every sect might unite in love
and charity to one another! They are all aiming alike
to love and serve Christ, and yet take no heed to his
commandment, ‘<span class='it'>Love ye one another!</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mamma, for the sake of his sweet daughter,
Naomi, I can forgive the good deacon. I have never
seen a more interesting face than hers, and her manners
are as graceful and lady-like as if she had never
seen the country,” said Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And most probably a great deal more so, my love,”
replied Mrs. Norton, “for nature can add a grace
which courts cannot give. But I agree with you in
thinking Miss Humphreys interesting; she is, indeed,
so, and if her countenance prove an index of her mind,
I think you may promise yourself a pleasing companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the deacon, it seems, was of a different way of
thinking, and no sooner did he enter under his own
roof, place his oak stick in the corner, and hang up his
hat on the peg behind the door, than going into the
kitchen where the good wife was busily employed preparing
the noonday meal, assisted by Naomi, he made
known with serious countenance, that he had discovered
<span class='it'>what they were</span> at Silver-Fall cottage!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Miss Norton was not such a companion
as they would choose for Naomi. True, she was a
pretty girl, and Mrs. Norton a lady of faultless manners;
but then so much the more danger, and therefore
Naomi, though not forbidden, was admonished to beware
of their new acquaintances.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Love Passages.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The summer passed, and in the bright month of
September, came Hubert Fairlie, to pass a few weeks
beneath the glad roof of his parents, whose only and
beloved child he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their warm welcome given, the first visit of Hubert
was to Naomi. They met as such young and ardent
friends meet after an absence of months, and Naomi
soon confided to him her regret that her parents would
not allow her to cultivate the friendship of Grace
Norton, whom she extolled in such warm and earnest
language, that Hubert found his curiosity greatly excited
to behold one calling forth such high eulogium
from the gentle Naomi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An evening walk was accordingly planned which
would lead them near the cottage, hoping by that means
to obtain a glimpse of its fair inmate. Fortune favored
them. As they came within view of the cottage, a
sweet voice was heard chanting the Evening Hymn
to the Virgin, and Hubert and Naomi paused to listen
to as heavenly sounds as ever floated on the calm
twilight air. Then as the song concluded, Grace
herself still sweeping her fairy fingers over the strings
to a lively waltz, sprang out from the little arbor, and
with her hair floating around her like stray sunbeams,
her beautiful blue eyes lifted upward, her white arms
embracing the guitar, and her graceful figure swaying
to the gay measure like a bird upon the tree-top, tripped
over the greensward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among other amusements which the deacon held in
great abhorrence was dancing, and Naomi had been
taught to look upon all such exhibitions as vain and
sinful. Yet never, I may venture to say, did any pair
of little feet so long to be set at liberty as did Naomi’s—<span class='it'>pat—pat—pat-ing</span>
the gravel-walk where they stood,
urging their young mistress to bound through the gate
and trip it with those other little feet twinkling so
fleetly to the merry music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheeks of Grace rivaled the hue of June roses,
as she suddenly encountered the gaze of a stranger;
but seeing Naomi, she hastened to greet her, and
thereby hide her embarrassment. Naomi introduced
her companion, and then Grace invited them to walk
in the garden, and look at her fine show of autumn
flowers. Minutes flew imperceptibly, and ere they
were aware, Hubert and Naomi found themselves
seated in the tasteful parlor of the cottage listening to
another sweet song from the lips of Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this is not precisely a love tale, I may as well
admit at once, that Hubert became deeply enamored
of the bewitching Grace, and from that evening was
a frequent and not unwelcome visiter—a fact which
was soon discovered by the deacon, for noting that
Hubert came not so often as was his wont to the farm,
he set about to find out what could have so suddenly
turned the footsteps of the young man from his door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, for his hopes of a son-in-law in Hubert! He
found those footsteps very closely on the track of as
dainty a pair of slippers as ever graced the foot of a
Cinderella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could exceed his disappointment, save the
pity he felt for his minister, whose son he considered
rushing blindly into the snares of the Evil One. Nay,
so far did he carry his pity as to warn Mr. Fairlie of
the <a id='dere'></a>dereliction of Hubert. But when that worthy
man reproved his uncharitableness, and acknowledged
that he could hope for no greater earthly happiness for
his son, than to see him the husband of so charming
and amiable a girl as Grace Norton, the deacon was
perfectly thunderstruck! It was dreadful—what would
the world come to! In short almost believing in the
apostacy of the minister himself, the deacon went home
groaning in spirit, as much perhaps for the frustration
of his own schemes, as for the “falling off,” as he
termed it of the reverend clergyman!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swift term of vacation expired, and Hubert returned
to college. His collegiate course would end
with the next term, and then it was his wish to commence
the study of the law. Mr. Fairlie was, perhaps,
somewhat disappointed that his son did not
adopt his own sacred profession; but he was a man
of too much sense to force the decision of Hubert or
thwart his wishes. He hoped to see him a good man
whatever might be his calling; and if ever youth gave
promise to make glad the heart of a parent, that youth
was Hubert Fairlie.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
The intercourse between Grace and Naomi from
this time almost wholly ceased, much to the regret of
both. Yet such were the orders of Deacon Humphreys,
whose good-will toward the widow and her
daughter was by no means strengthened by the events
of the last four weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why what have you done with Nelly to-day?”
asked Mrs. Humphreys, of her washerwoman, who
came every Monday morning, regularly attended by
a little ragged, half-starved girl of four years old, whose
province it was to pick up the <a id='pins'></a>clothes-pins, drive the hens
off the bleach, and keep the kittens from scalding their
frisky tails—receiving for her reward a thin slice of
bread and butter, or maybe, if all things went right,
and no thunder-squalls brewed, or sudden hurricanes
swept over the <a id='fold'></a>clothes-fold, a piece of gingerbread or a
cookey. “What, I say, have you done with Nelly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, ma’am, she has gone to school—only think of
it, my poor little Nelly has gone to <span class='it'>school</span>! It does
seem,” continued Mrs. White, resting her arms on the
tub, and holding suspended by her two hands a well-patched
shirt of the deacon’s, “it does seem as if the
Lord had sent that Mrs. Norton here to be a blessing
to the poor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” ejaculated Mrs. Humphreys, spitefully
rattling the dishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only think,” continued Mrs. White, “she has
given up one whole room in her house to Miss Grace,
who has been round and got all the children that can’t
go to school because their parents are too poor to send
them, and just teaches them herself for nothing! God
bless her, I say!” exclaimed the washerwoman, strenuously,
her tears mingling with the soap-suds into which
she now plunged her two arms so vigorously as to
dash the creaming foam to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Humphreys was at once surprised and angry.
She could not conceive why a lady like Mrs. Norton
should do such a thing as to keep a ragged school, and
that, too, without pay or profit. She had forgotten the
words of our blessed Lord, “<span class='it'>Whoso shall receive one
such little child in my name, receiveth me</span>,” or,
“<span class='it'>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
of these, ye have done it unto me.</span>” Charity alone,
she argued in her selfish nature, could not have influenced
Mrs. Norton to put herself to so much trouble
for a troop of noisy, dirty, half-clothed children! No,
there must be some deeper motive—some sectarian
object, perhaps, to be gained; and, impressed with this
idea, she said tartly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is a pretty piece of presumption in Mrs.
Norton to come here and set herself up in this way,
telling us as it were of our duty. She is a stranger,
and what business is it of hers, I should like to know,
whether the children go to school or not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Mrs. Humphreys, indeed, I think the spirit of
the Lord guides her!” said Mrs. White. “Miss
Grace came and asked me so humbly like, if I would
let her teach my Nelly, and then kissed the little fatherless
child so, so—that—that—O, I could have worshiped
her!” and fresh tears streamed down the cheeks
of the washerwoman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worship a fiddle-stick!” exclaimed Mrs. Humphreys,
out of all patience, “I know what she wants—an
artful creature; yes, she wants to make Nelly go
to her meeting!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Mrs. White could not help smiling at the idea
of attempting to form the religious creed of a child
scarce four years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if she will only make her as good as she is,
I don’t care!” she answered, “for the Bible says,
‘<span class='it'>By their fruits ye shall know them!</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Humphreys was more and more shocked at
this. She whispered it to Mrs. Smith, who whispered
it to Mrs. Jones, who told Mrs. Brown, who told all
the society, that the Nortons were wicked, designing
people, come into the village to stir up schism in the
church! Yet all sensible persons applauded the good
deed of the widow, and cheerfully aided her efforts.
The little school prospered even more than she had
dared to hope; the children were cheerful and happy,
and those whose parents could not afford them decent
clothing, were generously supplied by Mrs. Norton—and
many a heart blessed the hour which brought her
among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the thunder which suddenly rends the heavens,
when not a cloud on the blue expanse has heralded
the coming storm, was the calamity which now as
suddenly burst over the head of Mrs. Norton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She retired at night to her peaceful slumbers, supposing
herself the mistress of thousands. With the
early dawn there came letters to the cottage, telling
her that all her worldly possessions were swept from
her. The man to whose care her fortune was entrusted,
had basely defrauded her of every cent, and
now a bankrupt, had fled to a foreign land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stroke was a severe one. She must have been
divine to have resisted the first shock which the
tidings caused her. But that over, like a brave and
noble spirit she rose to meet it. Her treasures were
not all of earth—in heaven her hopes were garnered;
and, although henceforth her path in life might be in
rougher spots, and through darker scenes than it had
yet traversed, to that heaven she trusted to arrive
at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened, unfortunately, that the half-yearly rent
of the cottage became due that very week; and Mrs.
Norton, thus suddenly deprived of her expected funds,
had no means to meet it. Where should she raise two
hundred dollars! Her courage, however, rose with
her trials. A little time to look into her affairs—a little
time to form her plans for the future, and she doubted
not she should be able to liquidate the debt. Unused
to asking favors, she yet courageously went to Mr.
Humphreys, and stating candidly her inability to meet
the rent, requested a few weeks indulgence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deacon was not caught napping. Evil news
always travels with seven-league boots—and long ere
Mrs. Norton knocked at the door of the farm-house,
it was known throughout the village that her fortune
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the deacon, good man that he was, was “<span class='it'>given
to idols</span>,” and Mammon was one. Moreover, he
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
owed the widow a grudge, as we already know, and
the old leaven of sin was at work <span class='it'>beneath</span> the crust of
piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was accordingly well prepared to receive her.
And sorry, very sorry was the worthy deacon, but he
had just then a most pressing necessity for the rent—he
really must have it, if not in cash, perhaps Mrs.
Norton might have some plate to dispose of; he would
be happy to oblige her in that way, for the Lord forbid
he should deal hard with any one—<span class='it'>but</span>, the amount
<span class='it'>must</span> be paid when due. Wait he could not—and if
the rent was not forthcoming on the day stipulated in
the contract—why—why—he was very sorry—but
he should be obliged to take other measures, that
was all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Norton soiled not her lips by making any reply
to this Christian Shylock—no expostulation or entreaty—but
coldly bowing, she took her leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as she reached home she sent for a silver-smith,
brought out her valuable tea-set—doubly so from
having been the marriage gift of her father, requested
its <a id='app'></a>appraisal, and then duly attested as to its weight
and purity, it was forwarded to the clutches of the
deacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Norton met with a great deal of sympathy in
her misfortunes. During the few months she had resided
among them, the villagers had all learned to love
and respect her. Even the poor came from their
humble homes, and with looks of sympathy and out-stretched
hands tendered their offerings—their hard-earned
wages to the kind lady who had taught their
little ones; they would work for her—they would do
any thing to serve her. With a sweet smile Mrs.
Norton put back their grateful gifts, and thanked them
in gentle tones for their love—to her a far more acceptable
boon than gold could buy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Silver-Fall cottage fell back on the hands of
its owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dismissing her attendants, Mrs. Norton took a smaller
and cheaper house. Her choice and beautiful furniture
she sold, only retaining sufficient to render her
now humble residence comfortable. The avails of the
sale amounted to several hundred dollars—enough at
any rate, she deemed, for present necessities, while
she trusted in the meantime to find some means of
subsistence by which she and Grace might support
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What more noble spectacle, than an elegant, refined
woman thus meeting, uncomplaining and cheerfully,
the storm of adversity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Grace, too—sweet Grace—sang like a skylark,
and made her little white hands wonderfully busy in
household matters. Hubert Fairlie was yet absent,
though his long and frequent letters brought joy to the
heart of his beloved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And had Naomi forgotten her friend in this season
of trial! Not so; yet forbidden as we have seen from
the society of Grace, all she could do was to sympathize
deeply in spirit, happy when a chance opportunity
brought them together; and those meetings
although rare, only served to strengthen the friendship
which united these two lovely girls.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>When suddenly the Angel of Death folded his dark
wings, and sat brooding over the peaceful, pleasant
village of Grassmere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A terrible and malignant fever swept through the
town, spreading from house to house, like the fire
which consumes alike the dry grass and the bright,
fresh flowers of the prairies. Old and young, husband,
wife and child, were alike brought low. There were
not left in all the village those able to attend upon the
sick. From the churches solemnly tolled the funeral
bells, as one by one, youth and age, blooming childhood
and lovely infancy, were borne to the grave-yard—no
longer solitary—for the foot of the mourner
pressed heavily over its grass-grown paths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the contagion raged, until the selfishness of poor
human nature triumphed over the promptings of kindness
and charity. People grew jealous of each other;
neighbor shunned neighbor;</p>

<p class='line0'>Rose no smoke from the roofs—gleamed no lights from the windows.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>save the dim midnight lamp which from almost every
house betokened the plague within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None had shut themselves up closer from fear of
infection than Deacon Humphreys. His gates grew
rusty, and the grass sprang up in the paths about his
dwelling. And yet the Destroyer found him out, and
like a hound long scenting its prey, sprang upon the
household with terrible violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First the pure and gentle Naomi sank beneath the
stroke, and ere the setting of the same day’s sun, Mrs.
Humphreys herself was brought nigh the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like one demented, pale with agony and terror, the
deacon rushed forth into the deserted streets to seek
for aid. His dear ones—his wife and child were perhaps
dying; where, where should he look for relief—where
find some kind hand to administer to their
necessities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At every house he learned a tale of wo equal to his
own. Some wept while they told of dear ones now
languishing upon the bed of pain, or bade him look
upon the marble brow of their dead. Others grown
callous, and worn-out with sorrow and fatigue, refused
all aid, while some, through excess of fear, hurriedly
closed their doors against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he reached the end of the village, and then
the small, neat cottage of Mrs. Norton met his view,
nestling down amid the overshadowing branches of
two venerable elm. From the day he had almost
thrust her from his gate, with cold looks and unflinching
extortion, Mrs. Norton and the deacon had not
met, and now the time had come when he was about
to ask from her a favor upon which perhaps his whole
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
earthly happiness might rest—a favor from her, whom
in <span class='it'>his</span> strength and <span class='it'>her</span> dependence he had scorned.
Would she grant it? He hesitated; would she not
rather, rejoicing in her power now, revenge the slights
he felt he had so often and so undeservedly cast
upon her. But he remembered the sweet, calm look
which beamed from her eyes, and his courage grew
with the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Putting away the luxuriant creeper which wound
itself from the still green turf to the roof of the cottage,
hanging in graceful festoons, and tinged with the
brilliant dyes of autumn, seemed like wreaths of magnificent
flowers thus suspended, the deacon knocked
hesitatingly at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It opened, and Mrs. Norton stood before him, pale
with watching—for, like an angel of mercy had she
passed from house to house, since the first breaking
out of the scourge. In faltering accents he told his
errand; and, O, how like a dagger did it pierce his
heart, when, with a countenance beaming with pity
and kindness, and speaking words of comfort, the
widow put on her bonnet and followed him with fleet
footsteps to his stricken home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All night, like a ministering angel, did she pass from
one sick couch to the other, tenderly soothing the
ravings of fever, moistening their parched lips with
cool, refreshing drinks, fanning their fevered brows,
and smoothing the couch made uneasy by their restless
motions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unable to bear the scene, the deacon betook him in
his hour of sorrow to his closet, where all through the
dreary watches of the night he prayed this cup of
affliction might pass from him. His heart was subdued.
He saw that like the proud Pharisee he had exalted
himself, thanking God <span class='it'>he was not as other men</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At early dawn came Grace also to inquire after her
suffering Naomi, and finding her so very ill, earnestly
besought her mother that she might be allowed to
share the task of nursing her. Mrs. Norton had no
fears for herself, yet when she looked at her only and
beautiful child, she trembled; but her eyes fell upon
the bed where poor Naomi lay moaning in all the delirium
of high fever, and her heart reproached her for
her momentary selfishness. Removing the bonnet of
Grace, she tenderly kissed her pure brow, and then
kneeling down, with folded hands she prayed, “Thy
will, O Lord, not mine be done! Take her in thy
holy keeping, and do with her as thou seest best!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day Grace left not the bedside of her
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third day Mrs. Humphreys died. Her last
sigh was breathed out on the bosom of the woman
whom she had taught her daughter to shun. For many
days it seemed as if Death would claim another victim;
yet God mercifully spared Naomi to her bereaved
father; very slowly she recovered, but neither Mrs.
Norton nor Grace left her until she was able to quit
her bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the death of Mrs. Humphreys, the pestilence
staid its ravages, while, as a winding-sheet, the snows
of winter now enshrouded the fresh-turned clods in the
late busy grave-yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of Deacon Humphreys were opened. He
became an altered man. He saw how mistaken had
been his views, and that it is not the <span class='it'>profession</span> of
any sect or creed which makes the true Christian, and
that if all are alike <span class='it'>sincere in love to God</span>, all may be
alike received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said this was no love tale, therefore, by
merely stating that in the course of a twelvemonth
Hubert Fairlie and Grace were united, I close my
simple story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wigwam of the Indian during the evenings of
spring, that season when nature, loosed from the bondage
of winter, awakes to new life, and begins to deck
itself with beauties, the old sage gathers around him
the young men of the tribe, and relates the stories of
days long since departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen these youths sit in breathless silence,
listening to the old man’s narrative. Now and then
the tear-drops would course down their cheeks, and
fall to the ground, witnesses of the interest they felt in
the words of their teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To induce the sire to narrate a tradition, the Indian
boys would contrive some ingenious plan by which to
get some tobacco, which, when offered with a request
for a story, would be sure of a favorable answer.
Frequently it happens that from sunset to its rise these
clubs are entertained, and they do not separate till
daylight calls them to the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most interesting traditionary stories I
ever heard related, was told by an elderly Indian, one
evening in spring. The winter was just leaving, the
snow and ice were fast disappearing, and the streams
were swollen with the unusual quantity of water
from the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was once a time,” said he, “when this
world was filled with happy people, when all nations
were as one, and the crimson tide of war had not begun
to roll. Plenty of game were in the forests and on the
plains. None were in want, for a full supply was at
hand. Sickness was unknown. The beasts of the field
were tame, and came and went at the bidding of man.
One unending spring gave no place for winter, for its
cold blasts or its chills. Every tree and bush yielded
fruit. Flowers carpeted the earth; the air was filled
with their fragrance, and redolent with the songs of
myriad warblers that flew from branch to branch,
fearing none, for there were none to harm them.
There were birds then of more beautiful plumage than
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then, when earth was a paradise, and man
worthy to be its possessor, that Indians were the lone
inhabitants of the American wilderness. They numbered
millions, and living as nature designed them to
live, enjoyed its many blessings. Instead of amusement
in close rooms the sports of the fields were theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At night they met on the wide, green fields. They
watched the stars; they loved to gaze at them, for they
believed them to be the residences of the good who
had been taken home by the Great Spirit. One night
they saw one star that shone brighter than all others.
Its location was far away in the south, near a mountain
peak. For many nights it was seen, till at length
it was doubted by many that this star was as far off
in the southern skies as it seemed to be. This doubt
led to an examination, which proved the star to be only
a short distance, and near the tops of some trees. A
number of warriors were deputed to go and see what
it was. They went and returned, saying that it appeared
strange and somewhat like a bird. A council
of the wise men was called to inquire into and, if possible,
ascertain the meaning of the phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They feared that it was an omen of some disaster.
Some thought it a precursor of good, others of evil.
Some supposed it to be the star spoken of by their
forefathers, as a forerunner of a dreadful war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moon had nearly gone by, and yet the mystery
remained unsolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One night a young warrior had a dream, in which
a beautiful maiden came and stood at his side, and
thus addressed him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Young brave! charmed with the land of thy forefathers,
its flowers, its birds, its rivers, its beautiful
lakes and its mountains clothed with green, I have left
my sister in yonder world to dwell among you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Young brave! ask your wise and your great men
where I can live and see the happy race continually;
ask them what form I shall assume, in order to be loved
and cherished among the people.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus discoursed the bright stranger. The young
man awoke. On stepping out of his lodge, he saw the
star yet blazing in its accustomed place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At early dawn the chief’s crier was sent round the
camp to call every warrior to the Council Lodge.
When they had met, the young warrior related his
dream. They concluded that the star they had seen
in the south had fallen in love with mankind and that
it was desirous to dwell with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next night five tall, noble-looking adventurous
braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They went and presenting to it a pipe of peace,
filled with sweet-scented herbs, were rejoiced to find
that it took it from them. As they returned to the
village, the star, with expanded wings followed, and
hovered over their homes till the dawn of day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again it came to the young man in a dream and
desired to know where it should live, and what form
it should take. Places were named. On the tops of
giant trees or in flowers. At length it was told to
choose a place itself—and it did so. At first it dwelt
in the wild rose of the mountains, but there it was so
buried it could not be seen. It went to the prairie, but
it feared the hoof of the buffaloe. It next went to the
rocky cliff, but it was there so high that the children,
whom it loved most, could not see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know where I shall live,’ said the bright fugitive,
‘where I can see the gliding canoe of the race I
most admire. Children, yes, they shall be my playmates,
and I will kiss their brows when they slumber
at the side of the cool lakes. The nations shall love
me wherever I am.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
“These words having been uttered, she alighted on
the waters where she saw herself reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next morning thousands of white flowers were
seen on the surface of all the lakes and the Indians
gave them this name; <span class='it'>Wah-be-gwon-nee</span>—(White
Lily.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” continued the old man, “this star lived in
the southern skies. Its brethren can be seen far off in
the cold north, hunting the great bear, while its sisters
watch her in the east and west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Children, when you see the lily on the waters,
take it in your hands and hold it to the skies, that it
may be happy on earth, as its two sisters (the morning
and evening stars) are happy in heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While tears fell fast from the eyes of all, the old
man lay him down and was soon silent in sleep.</p>

<p class='line0'>Go bear the voiceless harp away!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Its latest note is spoken,</p>
<p class='line0'>And like the heart that beats within,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Its last frail chord is broken.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>This soul of mine was never made</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For glad or peaceful life,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For bitterness and strife.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I never was a careless child,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For in my early years</p>
<p class='line0'>The founts within were gathering,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of anguish and of tears:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And when I looked upon the stars</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In all their golden sheen,</p>
<p class='line0'>The presage of a broken heart—</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And then the Voice of Song awoke</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Within my wayward soul,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Forever o’er it roll.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And dreams of words that should go forth</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To bless and elevate,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Were mingled in my spirit’s depths,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>From day to day the lyre within</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jasper St. Aubyn opened his eyes, dim with
the struggle of returning consciousness and life, they
met a pair of eyes fixed with an expression of the most
earnest anxiety on his own—a pair of eyes, the loveliest
into which he ever had yet gazed, large, dark, unfathomably
deep, and soft withal and tender, as the
day-dream of a love-sick poet. He could not mark
their color; he scarce knew whether they were mortal
eyes, whether they were realities at all, so sickly
did his brain reel, and so confused and wandering
were his fancies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a sweet low voice fell upon his ear, in tones
the gentlest, yet the gladdest, that ever he had heard,
exclaiming⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! father, father, he lives—he is saved!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he heard, saw, no more; for again he relapsed
into unconsciousness, and felt nothing further, until he
became sensible of a balmy coolness on his brow, a
pleasant flavor on his parched lips, and a kindly glow
creeping as it were through all his limbs, and gradually
expanding into life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again his eyes were unclosed, and again they met
the earnest, hopeful gaze of those other eyes, which
he now might perceive belonging to a face so exquisite,
and a form so lovely, as to be worthy of those great
glorious wells of lustrous tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a young girl who bent over him, perhaps a few
months older than himself, so beautiful that had she
appeared suddenly, even in her simple garb, which
seemed to announce her but one degree above the
peasants of the neighborhood, in the midst of the
noblest and most aristocratical assembly, she would
have become on the instant the cynosure of all eyes,
and the magnet of all hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of that age when the heart, yet unsunned by passion,
and unused to strong emotion, thrills sensibly to
every feeling awakened for the first time within it, and
bounds at every appeal to its sympathies; when the
ingenuous countenance, unhardened by the sad knowledge
of the world, and untaught to conceal one emotion,
reflects like a perfect mirror every gleam of sunshine
that illuminates, every passing cloud that over-shadows
its pure and spotless surface, the maiden
sought not to hide her delight, as she witnessed the
hue of life return to his pale cheeks, and the spark of
intelligence relume his handsome features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bright mirthful glance, which told how radiant
they might be in moments of unmingled bliss, laughed
for an instant in those deep blue eyes, and a soft, sunny
smile played over her warm lips; but the next minute,
she dropped the young man’s hand, which she had
been chafing between both her own, buried her face
in her palms, and wept those sweet and happy tears
which flow only from innocent hearts, at the call of
gratitude and sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless God, young sir,” said a deep, solemn voice
at the other side of the bed on which he was lying,
“that your life is spared. May it be unto good ends!
Yours was a daring venture, and for a trivial object
against which to stake an immortal soul. But, thanks
to Him! you are preserved, snatched as it were from
the gates of death; and, though you feel faint now, I
doubt not, and your soul trembles as if on the verge of
another world, you will be well anon, and in a little
while as strong as ever in that youthful strength on
which you have so prided you. Drink this, and sleep
awhile, and you shall wake refreshed, and as a new
man, from the dreamless slumber which the draught
shall give you. And you, silly child,” he continued,
turning toward the lovely girl, who had sunk forward
on the bed, so that her fair tresses rested on the same
pillow which supported Jasper’s head, with the big
tears trickling silently between her slender fingers, “dry
up your tears; for the youth shall live, and not die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s eyes had turned immediately to the sound
of the speaker’s accents, and in his weak state remained
fixed on his face so long as the sound continued,
although his senses followed the meaning but
imperfectly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tall, venerable looking old man who spoke,
with long locks, as white as snow, falling down over
the straight cut collar of his plain black doublet, and
an expression of the highest intellect, combined with
something which was not melancholy, much less sadness,
but which told volumes of hardships borne, and
sorrows endured, the fruits of which were piety, and
gentleness, and that wisdom which cometh not of this
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled thoughtfully, as he saw that his words
were hardly comprehended, and his mild glance wandered
from the pale face of the handsome boy to the
fair head of the young girl bending over him, like a
white lily overcharged with rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor things,” he whispered softly, as if speaking
to himself, “to both it is the first experience of the
mixed pain and pleasure of this world’s daily trials.
God save them scathless to the end!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, recovering himself, as if by a little effort,
from his brief fit of musing, he held forth a large glass
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
goblet, which was in his right hand, full of some bright
ruby-colored liquid, to the lips of Jasper, saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink, youth, it will give thee strength. Drink,
and fear nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man grasped the bright bowl with both
hands, but even then he had lacked strength to guide
it to his lips, had not his host still supported it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flavor was agreeable, and the coolness of the
draught was so delicious to the feverish palate and
parched tongue of Jasper, that he drained it to the very
bottom, and then, as if exhausted by the effort, relaxed
his hold, and sunk back on his pillow in a state of conscious
languor, exquisitely soft and entrancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More and more that voluptuous dream-like trance
overcame him, and though his eyes were still open
he saw not the things that were around him, but a
multitude of radiant and lovely visions, which came
and went, and returned again, in mystic evolutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a last effort of his failing senses, half conscious
of the interest which she took in him, yet wholly ignorant
who or what was that gentle <span class='it'>she</span>, he stretched
out his hand and mastered one of hers with gentle violence,
and holding it imprisoned in his burning fingers,
closed his swimming eyes, and sunk into a deep and
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man, who had watched every symptom that
appeared in succession on his expressive face, saw
that the potion had taken the desired effect, and drawing
a short sigh, which seemed to indicate a sense of
relief from apprehension, looked toward the maiden,
and addressed her in a low voice, not so much from
fear of wakening the sleeper, as that the voice of affection
is ever low and gentle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sleeps, Theresa, and will sleep until the sun
has sunk far toward the west, and then he will waken
restored to all his youthful power and spirits. Come,
my child, we may leave him to his slumbers, he shall
no longer need a watcher. I will go to my study, and
would have you turn to your household duties. Scenes
such as this which you have passed will call up soft
and pitiful fancies in the mind, but it behooves us not
overmuch to yield to them. This life has too much of
stern and dark reality, that we should give the reins to
truant imagination. Come, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young girl raised her head from the pillows, and
shook away the long fair curls from her smooth forehead.
Her tears had ceased to flow, and there was a
smile on her lip, as she replied, pointing to her hand
which he held fast grasped, in his unconscious slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, father, I am a prisoner. I fear me I cannot
withdraw my hand without arousing him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not so, then, Theresa; to arouse him now, ere
the effects of the potion have passed away, would be
dangerous, might be fatal. Perchance, however, he
will release you when he sleeps quite soundly. If he
do so, I pray you, come to me. Meantime, I leave
you to your own good thoughts, my own little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with the words, he leaned across the narrow
bed, over the form of the sleeping youth, and kissed
her fair white brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless thee, my gentle child. May God in his goodness
bless and be about thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen! dear father,” said the little girl, as he ended;
and in her turn she pressed her soft and balmy lips to
his withered cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tear, rare visitant, rose all unbidden to the parent’s
eye as he turned to leave her, but ere he reached the
door her low tones arrested him, and he came back to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you not put my books within reach of me,
dear father?” she said. “I cannot work, since the
poor youth has made my left hand his sure captive,
but I would not be altogether idle, and I can read while
I watch him. Pardon my troubling you, who should
wait on you, not be waited on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you not wait on me ever, and most neat-handedly,
dear child?” returned her father, moving
toward a small round table, on which were scattered
a few books, and many implements of feminine industry.
“Which of these will you have, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of them, if you please, dear father. The table
is not heavy, for I can carry it about where I will myself,
and if you will lift it to me, I can help myself, and
cull the gems of each in turn. I am a poor student, I
fear, and love better, like a little bee, to flit from flower
to flower, drinking from every chalice its particular
honey, than to sit down, like the sloth, and surfeit me
on one tree, how green soever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is but little industry, I am afraid, Theresa,
if there be little sloth in your mode of reading. Such
desultory studies are wont to leave small traces on the
memory. I doubt me much if you long keep these
gems you speak of, which you cull so lightly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! but you are mistaken, father dear, for all you
are so wise,” she replied, laughing softly. “Every
thing grand or noble, of which I read, every thing high
or holy, finds a sort of echo in my little heart, and lies
there forever. Your grave, heavy, moral teachings
speak to my reason, it is true, but when I read of brave
deeds done, of noble self-sacrifices made, of great
sufferings endured, in high causes, those things teach
my heart, those things speak to my soul, father. Then
I reason no longer, but feel—feel how much virtue
there is, after all, and generosity, and nobleness, and
charity, and love, in poor frail human nature. Then I
learn, not to judge mildly of myself, nor harshly of my
brothers. Then I feel happy, father, yet in my happiness
I wish to weep. For I think noble sentiments
and generous emotions sooner bring tears to the eye
than mere pity, or mere sorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, even as she spoke, her own bright orbs were
suffused with drops, like dew in the violet’s cups, and
she shook her head with its profusion of long fair
ringlets archly, as if she would have made light of
her own sentiment, and gazed up into his face with a
tearful smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a good child, Theresa, and good children
are very dear to the Lord,” said the old man. “But
of a truth I would I could see you more practically
minded; less given to these singular romantic dreamings.
I say not that they are hurtful, or unwise, or
untrue, but in a mere child, as you are, Theresa, they
are strange and out of place, if not unnatural. I would
I could see you more merry, my little girl, and more
given to the company of your equals in age, even
if I were to be loser thereby of something of your
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
gentle company. But you love not, I think, the young
girls of the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! yes, I love them—I love them dearly, father.
I would do any thing for any one of them; I would
give up any thing I have got to make them happy.
Oh yes, I love Anna Harlande, and Rose Merrivale,
and Mary Mitford, dearly, but—but⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you love not their company, you would say,
would you not, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not what I was about to say; but I know
not how it is, their merriment is so loud, and their glee
so very joyous, that it seems to me that I cannot sympathize
with them in their joy, as I can in their sorrow;
and they view things with eyes so different from mine,
and laugh at thoughts that go nigh to make me weep,
and see or feel so little of the loveliness of Nature, and
care so little for what I care most of all, soft, sad
poetry, or heart-stirring romance, or inspired music,
that when I am among them, I <span class='it'>do</span> almost long to be
away from them all, in the calm of this pleasant chamber,
or in the fragrance of my bower beside the stream.
And I do feel my spirit jangled and perplexed by their
light-hearted, thoughtless mirth, as one feels at hearing
a false note struck in the midst of a sweet symphony.
What is this? what means this, my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a gift, Theresa,” replied the old man, half
mournfully. “It means that you are endowed rarely,
by God himself, with powers the most unusual, the
most wondrous, the most beautiful, most high and godlike
of any which are allowed to mortals. I have seen
this long, long ago—I have mused over it; hoped,
prayed, that it might not be so; nay, striven to repress
the germs of it in your young spirit, yet never have I
spoken of it until now; for I knew not that you were
conscious, and would not be he that should awaken
you to the consciousness of the grand but perilous possession
which you hold, delegated to you direct from
Omnipotence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, and she gazed at him with lips apart,
and eyes wide in wonder. The color died away in a
sort of mysterious awe from her warm cheek. The
blood rushed tumultuously to her heart. She listened
breathless and amazed. Never had she heard him
speak thus, never imagined that he felt thus, before—yet
now that she did hear, she felt as though she were
but listening again to that which she had heard many
times before; and though she understood not his words
altogether, they had struck a kindred chord in her inmost
soul, and while its vibration was almost too much
for her powers of endurance, it yet told her that his
words were true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not for her life have bid him go on, but
for worlds she would not have failed to hear him
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched the changed expression of her features,
and half struck with a feeling of self-reproach that he
should have created doubts, perhaps fears, in that ingenuous
soul, smiled on her kindly, and asked in a
confident tone⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have felt this already, have you not, my
child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as you put it to me, father; no, I have never
dreamed or hoped that I had any such particular gift
of God, such glorious and preëminent possession as
this of which you speak. I may, indeed, have fancied
at times that there was something within me, in which
I differed from others around me—something which
made me feel more joy, deeper, and fuller, and more
soul-fraught joy, than they feel; and sorrow, softer,
and moved more easily, if not more piercing or more
permanent—which made me love the world, and its
inhabitants, and above all its Maker, with a far different
love from theirs—something which evermore
seems struggling within me, as if it would forth and
find tongue, but cannot. But now, that you have
spoken, I know that it indeed must be as you say, and
that this unknown something is a gift, is a possession
from on high. What is this thing, my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, this thing is genius,” replied the old
man solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright blood rushed back to her cheeks in a
flood of crimson glory; a strange, clear light, which
never had enkindled them before, sprang from her soft
dark eyes; she leaned forward eagerly⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Genius!” she cried. “Genius, and I! Father,
you dream, dear father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would that I did; but I do not, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wherefore, if it be so, indeed, that I am so
gifted, wherefore would you alter it, my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not alter it,” he replied, “my little girl.
Far be it from my thoughts, weak worm that I am, to
alter, even if I could alter, the least of the gifts of the
great Giver. And this, whether it be for good, or unto
evil, is one of the greatest and most glorious. I would
not alter it, Theresa. But I would guide, would
direct, would moderate it. I would accustom you to
know and comprehend the vast power of which you,
all unconsciously, are the possessor. For, as I said,
it is a fearful and a perilous power. God forbid that I
should pronounce the most marvelous and godlike of
the gifts which he vouchsafes to man, a curse and not
a blessing; God forbid that, even while I see how oft
it is turned into bitterness and blight by the coldness of
the world, and the check of its heaven-soaring aspirations,
I should doubt that it has within itself a sovereign
balm against its own diseases, a rapture mightier
than any of its woes, an inborn and eternal consciousness
which bears it up, as on immortal pinions, above
the cares of the world and the poor consciousness of
self. Nevertheless it is a perilous gift, and too often,
to your sex, a fatal one. Yet I would not alarm you,
my own child, for you have gentleness of soul, which
may well temper the coruscations of a spirit which
waxes oftentimes too strong to be womanly, and piety
which shall, I trust, preserve you, should any aspiration
of your heart wax over vigorous and daring to be
contented with the limitations of humanity. In the
meantime, my child, fear nothing, follow the dictates
of your own pure heart, and pray for His aid, who
neither giveth aught, nor taketh away, without reason.
Hark!” he interrupted himself, starting slightly,
“there is a sound of horses’ hoofs without; your
brother has returned, and it may be Sir Miles is with
him. We will speak more of this hereafter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with the word he turned and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was gone she raised her eyes to heaven,
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
and with a strange rapt expression on her fair features
rose to her feet, exclaiming⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Genius! Genius! Great God, Great God, I thank
thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in the fervor of the moment, which led her
naturally to clasp her hands together, she made a
movement to withdraw her fingers from Jasper’s deathlike
grasp, unconscious, for the time, of every thing
around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as she did so, a tightened pressure of his hand,
and some inarticulate sounds which proceeded from
his lips, recalled her with a start to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped into her seat, as if conscience-stricken,
gazed fixedly in his face, then stooped and pressed her
lips on his inanimate brow; started again, looked about
the room with a half guilty glance, bowed her head on
his pillow, and wept bitterly.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The evening had advanced far into night before the
effects of the potion he had swallowed passed away,
and left the mind of Jasper clear, and his pulse regular
and steady. When he awoke from his long stupor,
and turned his eyes around him, it seemed as if he had
dreamed of what he saw before him; for the inanimate
objects of the room, nay, the very faces which
met his eye, had something in them that was not altogether
unfamiliar, yet for his life he could not have recalled
when, or if ever he had seen them before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old dark-wainscoted walls of the irregular,
many-recessed apartment, adorned with a few watercolor
drawings, and specimens of needle-work, the
huge black and gold Indian cabinet in one corner, the
tall clock-stand of some foreign wood in another, the
slab above the yawning hearth covered with tropical
shells and rare foreign curiosities, the quaint and grotesque
chairs and tables, with strangely contorted legs
and arms, and wild satyr-like faces grinning from their
bosses, the very bed on which he lay, with its carved
head-board, and groined canopy of oak, and dark
green damask curtains, were all things which he felt
he must have seen, though where and how he knew
not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So was the face of the slight fair-haired girl who sat
a little way removed from his bed’s head, by a small
round work-table, on which stood a waxen taper,
bending over some one of those light tasks of embroidery
or knitting which women love, and are wont
to dignify by the name of work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On her he fixed his eyes long and wistfully, gazing
at her, as he would have done at a fair picture, without
any desire to address her, or to do aught that should
induce her to move from the graceful attitude in which
she sat, giving no sign of life save in the twinkling of
her long, downcast eyelashes, in the calm rise and fall
of her gentle bosom, and the quick motion of her busy
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper St. Aubyn was still weak, but he was unconscious
of any pain or ailment, though he now began
gradually to remember all that had passed before he
lost his consciousness in the deep pool above the fords
of Widecomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So weak was he, indeed, that it was almost too
great an effort for him to consider where he was, or
how he had been saved, much more to move his body,
or ask any question of that fair watcher. He felt indeed
that he should be perfectly contented to lie there
all his life, in that painless tranquil mood, gazing upon
that fair picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while he lay there, with his large eyes wide
open and fixed upon her, as if by their influence he
would have charmed her soul out of its graceful habitation,
a word or two spoken in a louder voice than
had yet struck his ear, for persons had been speaking
in the room all the time, although he had not observed
them, attracted his notice to the other side of his bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not so much the words, for he scarce heard,
and did not heed their import, as the tone of voice
which struck him; for though well-known and most
familiar, he could in no wise connect it with the other
things around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the desire to ascertain what this might mean,
there came into his mind, he knew not wherefore, a
wish to do so unobserved; and he proceeded forthwith
to turn himself over on his pillow so noiselessly as to
excite no attention in the watchers, whoever they
might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not made two efforts, however, to do this,
before he became aware of what, while he lay still, he
did not suspect, that several of his limbs had received
severe contusions, and could not as yet be moved with
impunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a singular youth, however, and an almost
Spartan endurance of physical pain, with a strange
<a id='pers'></a>persistence in whatever he undertook, had been from
very early boyhood two of his strongest characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite, therefore, of his weakness, in spite of the
pain every motion gave him, he persevered, and turning
himself inch by inch, at length gained a position
which enabled him clearly to discern the speakers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were two in number, the one facing him, the
other having his back turned so completely that all he
could see was a head covered with long-curled locks
of snow-white hair, a dark velvet cloak, and the velvet
scabbard of a long rapier protruding far beyond the
legs of the oak chair on which he sat. The lower
limbs of this person were almost lost in darkness as
they lay carelessly crossed under the table, so that he
divined rather than saw that they were cased in heavy
riding-boots, on the heels of which a faint golden glimmer
gave token of the wearer’s rank, by the knightly
spurs he wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lamp which stood upon the table by which they
were conversing was set between the two, so that it
was quite invisible to Jasper, and its light, which to
his eyes barely touched the edges of the figure he had
first observed, fell full upon the pale high brow and
serene lineaments of the other person, who was in fact
no other than the old man who had spoken to the
youth in the intervals of his trance, and administered
the potion from the effects of which he was but now
recovering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of this, however, Jasper had no recollection, although
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
he wondered, as he had done concerning the
girl, where he had before seen that fine countenance
and benevolent expression, and how once seen he ever
should have forgotten it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was yet a third person in the group, though
he took no part in the conversation, and appeared to
be, like Jasper, rather an interested and observant witness
of what was going on, than an actor in the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a tall, dark-haired and dark-eyed man, in
the first years of manhood, not perhaps above five or
six years Jasper’s senior; but his bronzed and sunburnt
cheeks curiously contrasted with the fairness of his
forehead, where it had not been exposed to the sun,
and an indescribable blending of boldness, it might have
almost been called audacity, with calm self-confidence
and cold composure, which made up the expression of
his face, seemed to indicate that he had seen much of
the world, and learned many of its secrets, perhaps by
the stern lessoning of the great teachers, suffering and
sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure of this young man was but imperfectly
visible, as he stood behind the high-backed chair, on
which the old man, whom from the similarity in their
features, if not in their expression, Jasper took to be
his father, was seated. But his face, his muscular
neck, his well-developed chest and broad shoulders,
displayed by a close-fitting jerkin of some dark stuff,
were all in strong light; and as the features and expression
of the countenance gave token of a powerful
character and energetic will, so did the frame give
promise of ability to carry out the workings of the
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dialogue, which had been interrupted by a
silence of some seconds following on the words that had
attracted Jasper’s notice, was now continued by the
old man who sat facing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That question,” he said, in a firm yet somewhat
mournful tone, “is not an easy one to answer. The
difficulty of subduing prejudices on my own part, the
fear of wounding pride on yours—these might have
had their share in influencing my conduct. Beside,
you must remember that years have elapsed—the very
years which most form the character of men—since
we parted; that they have elapsed under circumstances
the most widely different for you and for me; that we
are not, in short, in any thing the same men we then
were—that the gnarled, weather-beaten, earth-fast
oak of centuries differs not so much from the green
pliant sapling of half a dozen summers, as the old man,
with his heart chilled and hardened into living steel by
contact with the world, from the youth full of generous
impulses and lofty aspirations, loving all men, and
doubting naught either in heaven above, or in the earth
beneath. You must remember, moreover, that although,
as you have truly said, we were friends in youth, our
swords, our purses, and our hearts in common, we had
even then many points of serious difference; and lastly,
and most of all, you must remember that if we had
been friends, we were not friends when we last
parted⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! what!” exclaimed a voice, which Jasper
instantly recognized for his father’s, though for years
he had not heard him speak in tones of the like animation.
“What, William Allan, do you mean to say that
you imagined that any enmity could have dwelt in my
mind, for so slight a cause⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slight a cause!” interrupted the other. “Do you
call that <span class='it'>slight</span> which made my heart drop blood, and
my brain boil with agony for years—which changed
my course of life, altered my fortunes, character, heart,
soul, forever; which made me, in a word, what I now
am? Do you call that a <span class='it'>slight</span> cause, Miles St.
Aubyn? Show me, then, what you call a grave one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten, William, I had forgotten,” replied
Sir Miles, gently, and perhaps self-reproachfully. “I
mean, I had forgotten that the rivaling in a strife which
to the winner seems a little thing, may to the loser be
death, or worse than death! Forgive me, William
Allan, I had forgotten in my selfish thoughtlessness,
and galled you unawares. But let us say no more of
this—let the past be forgotten—let wrongs done, if
wrongs were done, be buried in her grave, who was
the most innocent cause of them; and let us now remember
only that we were friends in youth, and that
after long years of separation, we are thus wonderfully
brought together in old age; let me hope to be friends
henceforth unto the grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen, I say to that. Miles St. Aubyn, amen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the two old men clasped their withered hands
across the table, and Jasper might see the big drops
trickling slowly down the face of him who was called
William Allan, while from the agitation of his father’s
frame he judged that he was not free from the like
agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little pause, during which, as he fancied
the young man looked somewhat frowningly on the
scene of reconciliation; but the frown, if frown it
were, passed speedily away, and left the bold, dark
face as calm and impassive as the surface of a deep
unruffled water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment or two afterward, Sir Miles raised his
head, which he had bowed a little, perhaps to conceal
the feelings which might have agitated it, and again
clasping the hand of the other, said eagerly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is you, William, who have saved my boy, my
Jasper; and this is not the first time that a scion of
your house has preserved one of mine from death, or
yet worse, ruin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Allan started, as if a sharp weapon had
pierced him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how,” he cried, “Miles St. Aubyn, how was
the debt repaid? I tell you it is written in the books
that cannot err, that our houses were ordained for
mutual destruction!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, man,” exclaimed Sir Miles, half jestingly,
“do you still cling to the black art? Do you still read
the dark book of fate? Methought that fancy would
have taken wing with other youthful follies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man shook his head sadly, but made no
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what has it taught <span class='it'>thee</span>, William, unless it be
that this life is short, and this world’s treasures worthless;
and <span class='it'>that</span> I have learned from a better book, a
book of wider margin. What, I say, has it taught
thee, William Allan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All things,” replied the old man, sorrowfully.
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
“Even unto this meeting—every action, every event
of my own life, past or to come, happy or miserable,
virtuous or evil, it has taught me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But has it taught thee, William, whereby to win
the good and eschew the evil; whereby to hold fast to
the virtuous, and say unto the evil, ‘get behind me?’
Has it taught thee, I say not to be wiser, but to be
happier or better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is, is! What shall be, shall be! What is
written, shall be done! We may flap, or flutter, or
even fight, like fish or birds, or, if you will, like lions
in the toil; but we are netted, and may not escape,
from the beginning! The man may learn the workings
of the God, but how shall he control them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is thy philosophy—this all that thine art
teaches?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is. No more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sad philosophy—a vain art,” replied the other.
“I’ll none of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell thee, Miles St. Aubyn, that years ago, years
ere I <a id='had'></a>had heard of Widecomb or its water, I saw
yon deep, red-whirling pool; I saw that drowning
youth; I saw the ready rescue, and the gentle nursing;
and now,” he cried, stretching his hands out widely,
and gazing into vacancy, “I see a wilder and a sadder
sight—a deeper pool, a stronger cataract, a fierce storm
thundering on the hills, and torrents thundering down
every gorge and gully to swell the flooded rivers.
A young man and a maiden—yet no! no! not a maiden!
mounted on gallant horses, are struggling in the whelming
eddies. Great God! avert—hold! hold! He lifts
his arm, he smites her with his loaded whip—smites
her between the eyes that smile upon him; she falls, she
is down, down in the whirling waters—rider and horse
swept over the mad cataract; but who—who?—ha!”
and with a wild shriek he started to his feet, and fell
back into the arms of the young man, who from the
beginning of the paroxysm evidently had expected its
catastrophe, and who, with the assistance of the girl,
supported him, now quite inanimate and powerless,
from the room, merely saying to Sir Miles, “Be not
alarmed, I will return forthwith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father!” exclaimed Jasper, in a faint voice, as
the door closed upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man turned hastily to the well-known accents,
and hurried to the bed-side. “My boy, my own
boy, Jasper. Now, may God’s name be praised forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And falling into a chair by his pillow, the same chair
on which that sweet girl had sat a few hours before,
he bent over him, and asked him a thousand questions,
waiting for no reply, but bathing his face with his tears,
and covering his brow with kisses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had at length satisfied the old man that he
was well and free from pain, except a few slight bruises,
he asked his father eagerly where he was, and who
was that strange old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are in the cottage, my dear boy,” replied the
old knight, “above Widecomb pool, tended by those
who, by the grace of God and his exceeding mercy,
saved you from the consequences of the frantic act
which so nearly left me childless. Oh! Jasper, Jasper,
’twas a fearful risk, and had well-nigh been fatal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was but one misstep, father,” replied the youth,
who, as he rapidly recovered his strength, recovered
also his bold speech and daring courage. “Had there
been but foot-hold at the tunnel’s end, I had landed my
fish bravely; and, on my honor, I believe had I such
another on my line’s end, I should risk it again. Why,
father, he was at least a thirty pounder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never do so—never do so again, Jasper. Remember
that to risk life heedlessly, and for no purpose save
an empty gratification, a mere momentary pleasure, is
a great crime toward God, and a gross act of selfishness
toward men, as much so as to peril or to lose it in
a high cause, or for a noble object, is great and good,
and self-devoted. Think! had you perished here, all
for a paltry fish, which you might purchase for a silver
crown, you had left to me years—nay, a life of misery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, father, I never thought of that,” answered
the young man, not unmoved by the remonstrance of
his father, “but it was not the value of the fish. I
should have given him away ten to one, had I taken
him. It was that I do not like to be beaten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good feeling, Jasper; and one that leads to many
good things, and without which nothing great can be
attained; but to do good, like all other feelings, it must
be moderated and controled by reason. But you must
learn to think ever before acting, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will—I will, indeed, sir; but you have not told
me who is this strange old man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An old friend of mine, Jasper—an old friend whom
I have not seen for years, and who is now doubly a
friend, since he has saved your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the door opened, and the young man
entered bearing a candle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is at ease now,” he said. “It is a painful and
a searching malady to which at seasons he is subject.
We know well how to treat him; when he awakes tomorrow,
he will remember nothing of what passed to-day,
though at the next attack he will remember every
circumstance of this. I pray you, therefore, Sir Miles,
take no note in the morning, nor appear to observe it,
if he be somewhat silent and reserved. Ha! young
sir,” he continued, seeing that Jasper was awake, and
taking him kindly by the hand, “I am glad to see that
you have recovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am glad to have an opportunity to thank you,
that you have saved my life, which I know you must
have done right gallantly, seeing the peril of the deed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About as gallantly as you did, when you came so
near losing it,” he answered. “But come, Sir Miles,
night wears apace, and if you will allow me to show you
to your humble chamber, the best our lowly house can
offer, I will wish you good repose, and return to watch
over my young friend here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My age must excuse me, that I accept your offer,
whose place it should be to watch over him myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need no watcher, sir,” replied Jasper, boldly.
“I am quite well now, and shall sleep, I warrant you,
unto cock-crow without awakening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, then, boy!” cried Sir Miles, stooping
over him and again kissing his brow, “and God send
thee better in health and wiser in condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, sir; and God send me stronger and
braver, and more like my father,” said the youth, with
a light laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
“I will return anon, young friend—for friends, I
hope, we shall be,” said the other, as he left the room
lighting Sir Miles respectfully across the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope we shall—and I thank you. But I shall be
fast asleep ere then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he was; but not the less for that did the
stalwart young man watch over him, sitting erect in
one of the high-backed chairs, until the first pale light
of dawn came stealing in through the latticed casement,
and the shrill cry of the early cock announced the
morning of another day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earliest cock had barely crowed his first salutation
to the awakening day, and the first warblers had
not yet begun to make their morning music in the thick
shrubberies around the cottage, when aroused betimes
by his anxiety for Jasper, Sir Miles made his appearance,
already full dressed, at the door of the room in
which his son was sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he was still asleep, with that hardy young man
still watching over him, apparently unmoved by the
loss of his own rest, and wholly indifferent to what are
usually deemed the indispensable requirements of
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are afoot betimes, sir,” said the youth, rising
from his seat as the old cavalier entered the room;
“pity that you should have arisen so early, for I could
have watched him twice as long, had it been needful,
but in truth it was not so. Your son has scarce moved,
Sir Miles, since you left the chamber last night. You
see how pleasantly and soundly he is sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not <span class='it'>that</span>, young sir,” replied the old man,
cordially. “It was not that I doubted your good will,
or your good watching either; but he is my son, my
only son, and how should I but be anxious. But as
you say, he sleeps pleasantly and well. God be thanked
therefore. He will be none the worse for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, perhaps, Sir Miles,” replied the other, with
a slight smile. “Wiser, at least, I doubt not he will
be; for in good truth, it was a very boyish, and a very
foolish risk to run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man, for the first time, looked at the speaker
steadfastly, and was struck by the singular expression
of his countenance—that strange mixture of impassive
self-confident composure, and half-scornful audacity,
which I have mentioned as being his most striking
characteristics. On the preceding evening, Sir Miles
had been so much engrossed by the anxiety he felt
about his son, and subsequently by the feelings called
forth in his inmost heart by the discovery of an old
comrade in the person of William Allan, that in fact
he had paid little attention to either of the other personages
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had observed, indeed, that there were a fair
young girl and a powerfully framed youth present; he
had even addressed a few words casually to both of
them, but they had left no impression on his mind, and
he had not even considered who or what they were
likely to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, however, when he was composed and relieved
of fear for his son’s life, he was struck, as I have said,
by the expression and features of the young man, and
began to consider who he could be; for there was no
such similarity, whether of feature, expression, voice,
air or gesture, between him and William Allan, as is
wont to exist between son and sire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s pause, however, the old cavalier
replied, not altogether pleased apparently by the tone
of the last remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a very bold and <span class='it'>manly</span> risk, it appears to
me,” he said, “and if rash, can hardly be called boyish;
and you, I should think,” he added, “would be the
last to blame bold actions. You look like any thing
but one who should recommend cold counsels, or be
slack either to dare or do. I fancy you have seen
stirring times somewhere, and been among daring deeds
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So many times, Sir Miles,” replied the young man,
modestly, “that I have learned how absurd it is to <span class='it'>seek</span>
such occasions without cause. There be necessary
risks enough in life, and man has calls enough, and
those unavoidable, on his courage, without going out
of his way to seek them, or throwing any energy or
boldness unprofitably to the winds. At least so I have
found it in the little I have seen of human life and
action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! you speak well,” said Sir Miles, looking even
more thoughtfully than before at the marked and somewhat
weatherbeaten features of the young man.
“And where have you met with perils so rife, and
learned so truly the need of disciplining natural energies
and valor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the high seas, Sir Miles, of which I have been
a follower from a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! are you such a voyager! and where, I
pray you, have you served?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot say that I have exactly <span class='it'>served</span>. But I
have visited both the Indias, East and West; and have
seen some smart fighting—where they say peace never
comes—beyond the Line, I mean, with the Dons, both
in Darien and Peru.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! but you have indeed seen the world, for one
so young as you; and yet I think you have not sailed
in the king’s ships, nor held rank in the service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Sir Miles, I am but a poor free-trader; and
yet sometimes I think that we have carried the English
flag farther, and made the English name both better
known, and more widely feared, than the cruisers of
any king who has sat on our throne, since the good old
days of Queen Bess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His present majesty did good service against the
Dutch, young man. And what say you to Blake?
Who ever did more gloriously at sea, than rough old
Blake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, sir, but that was in Noll’s days, and we may
not call him a <span class='it'>king</span> of England, though of a certainty
he was her wise and valiant ruler. And for his present
majesty, God bless him! that Opdam business was
when he was the Duke of York; and he has forgotten
all his glory, I think, now that he has become king,
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
and lets the Frenchman and the Don do as they please
with our colonists and traders, and the Dutchman, too,
for that matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man paused, and shook his head gravely
for a moment, but then resumed with a smile,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, so, my young friend, you are one of those bold
spirits who claim to judge for yourselves, and make
peace or war, as you think well, without waiting the
slow action of senates or kings, who hold that hemispheres,
not treaties, are the measure of hostility or
amity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, exactly, noble sir. But where we find
peace or war, there we take them; and if the Dons
wont be quiet on the other side the Line, and our good
king wont keep them quiet, why we must either take
them as we find them, or give up the great field to
them altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which you hold to be unEnglish and unmanly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I, for one, will not gainsay you. But do not
you fear, sometimes that while you are thus stretching
a commission—that is the term, I believe, among you
liberal gentlemen—you may chance to get your own
neck stretched some sultry morning in the Floridas or
in Darien.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the very risks I spoke of but now, Sir
Miles,” replied the young man, laughing. “My life
were not worth five minutes’ purchase if the Governor
of St. Augustine, or of Panama either, for that matter,
could once lay hold on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I marvel,” said the old cavalier, again shaking his
head solemnly, “I marvel much—” and then interrupting
himself suddenly in the middle of his sentence,
he lapsed into a fit of meditative silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At what, if I may be so bold—at what do you so
much marvel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That William Allan should consent,” replied the
cavalier, “that son of his should embark in so wild
and stormy a career, in a career which, I should have
judged, with his strict principles and somewhat puritanical
feeling, he would deem the reverse of gracious
or godfearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows not what career I follow,” answered
the young man, bluntly. “But you are in error altogether,
sir. I am no son of William Allan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No son of William Allan! Ha! now that I think
of it, your features are not his, nor your voice either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor my body, nor my soul!” replied the other,
hastily and hotly, “no more than the free falcon’s are
those of the caged linnet! Sometimes I even marvel
how it can be that any drop of mutual or common blood
should run in our veins; and yet it is so—and I—I—yet
no—I do <span class='it'>not</span> repent it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wherefore should you? there is no worthier
or better man, I do believe, than William Allan living;
and, in his younger days at least, I know there was no
braver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No braver?—indeed! indeed!” exclaimed the
young man, eagerly—“was he, indeed, brave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, was he, youth! brave both to do and to suffer.
Brave, both with the quick and dauntless courage to
act, and with the rarer and more elevated courage to
resolve and hold fast to resolution. But who are you,
who, living with him, know both so little and so much
of William Allan? If you be not his son, who are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His sister’s son, Sir Miles—his only sister’s son,
to whom, since that sister’s death, he has been—God
forgive me for that I said but now—more than a father;
for surely I have tried him more than ever son tried a
father, and he has borne with me still with a most
absolute indulgence and unwearied love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what!” exclaimed Sir Miles, much moved
and even agitated by what he heard, “are you the
child of that innocent and beautiful Alicia Allan, whom—whom—”
The old man faltered and stopped short,
for he was in fact on the point of bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the youth finished the sentence which he had
left unconcluded, in a stern, slow voice, and with a
lowering brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom your friend, Durzil Olifaunt, betrayed by a
mock marriage, and afterward deserted with her
infants. Yes, Sir Miles, I am one of those infants, the
son of Alicia Allan’s shame! And my uncle did not
slay him—therefore it is I asked you, was he brave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet he <span class='it'>was</span> slain—and for that very deed!”
replied the old man, gloomily, with his eyes fixed upon
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>was</span> slain,” repeated the young sailor, whose
curiosity and interest were now greatly excited. “But
how can you tell wherefore? No one has ever known
who slew him—how, then, can you name the cause
of his slaying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is <span class='sc'>One</span> who knows all things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='sc'>He</span> imparts not his knowledge,” answered the
other, not irreverently. “And unless <span class='it'>you</span> slew him,
I see not how you can know this. Yet, hold, hold!”
he continued impetuously, as he saw that Sir Miles
was about to speak, “if you did slay him, tell it not;
for if he did betray my mother, if he did abandon me
to disgrace and ruin—still, still he was my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I slew him not, young man,” replied the cavalier,
gravely, “but he was slain for the cause that I have
named, and I saw him die—repentant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Repentant!” exclaimed the youth, grasping the
withered hand of the old knight, in the intensity of his
emotions, “did he repent the wrong he had done my
mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As surely as he died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May God forgive him, then,” said the seaman,
clasping his hands together and bursting into tears,
“as I forgive him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen! amen!” cried the knight, “for he was
mine ancient friend, the comrade of my boyhood, before
he did that thing; and I, too, have something to
forgive to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Sir Miles, you!—what can you have to
forgive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me first, tell me—how are you named?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Durzil,” answered the youth, “Durzil, <span class='it'>Nothing</span>!”
he added, very bitterly, “my country, and my
country’s law give me no other name, but only Durzil—its
enemies have named me <span class='it'>Bras-de-fer</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then mark me, Durzil; as he of whom you are
sprung, of whom you are named, was my first friend,
so was your mother my first love; and she returned
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
my love, till he, my sometime confidant, did steal her
from me, and made his paramour, whom I had made
my wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great God!” exclaimed the young man, struck
with consternation; “then it must, it must have been
so—it was you who slew my—my father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young man, I never lied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, Sir Miles. Pardon me, I am half distraught.
And you loved my mother, and—and—he
repented. Why was not I told of this before? And
yet,” he added, again pausing, as if some fresh suspicion
struck him, “and yet how is this? I heard you
speak yester even to my uncle, of wrongs done—done
by yourself to <span class='it'>him</span>, and of a woman’s death—that
woman, therefore, was not, could not have been <span class='it'>my</span>
mother. Who, then, was <span class='it'>she</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>His</span> mother,” replied Sir Miles St. Aubyn, calmly,
but sadly, pointing to the bed on which Jasper lay
sleeping tranquilly and all unconsciously of the strange
revelations which were going on around him. “If
my friend robbed me of William Allan’s sister, so I
won from William Allan, in after days, her who owned
his affection; but with this difference, that she I won
never returned your uncle’s love from the beginning,
and that I never betrayed his confidence. If I were
the winner, it was in fair and loyal strife, and though
it has been, as I learned for the first time last night, a
sore burthen on your uncle’s heart, it has been none on
my conscience; my withers are unwrung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it, sir; from my soul, I believe it,”
cried the young man, enthusiastically, “for, on my life,
I think you are all honor and nobility. But tell me,
tell me now, if you love, if you pity me—as you should
do for my mother’s sake—who slew my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sworn,” answered the cavalier, “I have
sworn never to reveal that to mortal man; and if I had
not sworn, to <span class='it'>you</span> I could not reveal it; for, if I judge
aright, you would hold yourself bound to⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avenge it!” exclaimed the youth, fiercely, interrupting
him; “ay, were it at my soul’s purchase—since
he repented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>did</span> repent, Durzil; nay, more, he died, desiring
only that he could repair the wrong he had done
you, regretting only that he could not give you his name
and his inheritance, as he did give <span class='it'>you</span> his dying blessing,
and your mother his last thought, his last word in
this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did <span class='it'>she</span> know this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Durzil, I cannot answer you; for within a few
days after your father’s death, I left England for the
Low Countries, and returned not until many a year
had passed into the bygone eternity. When I did return,
the sorrows of Alicia Allan were at an end forever;
and though I then made all inquiries in all quarters, I
could learn nothing of your uncle or yourself, nor ever
have heard of you any more until last night, when we
were all so singularly brought together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>ought</span> to have known this; I would, I would to
God that I <span class='it'>had</span> known it. My life had been less wild,
then, less turbulent, less stormy. My spirit had not
then burned with so rash a recklessness. It was the
sense of wrong, of bitter and unmerited wrong done
in past times, of cold and undeserved scorn heaped
on me in the present, as the bastard—the child of infamy
and shame! that goaded me into so hot action.
But it is done now, it is done, and cannot be amended.
The world it is which has made me what I am—let
the world look to it—let the world enjoy the work of
its hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing, Durzil,” said the old man,
solemnly, “nothing but death that cannot be amended.
<span class='it'>Undone</span> things may not be, but all may be amended,
by God’s good grace to aid us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hast thou not seen a sapling in the forest, which,
overcrowded by trees of stronger growth, or warped
from its true direction by some unnoted accident, hath
grown up vigorous indeed and strong, but deformed
and distorted in its yearly progress, until arrived at its
full maturity, not all the art or all the strength of man
or man’s machinery can force it from its bias, or make
it straight and comely? So is it with the mind of man,
Sir Miles. While it is young and plastic, you shall
direct it as you will—once ripened, hardened in its
growth, whether that growth be tortuous or true, as
soon shall you remodel the stature of the earth-fast
oak, as change its intellectual bias. But I am wearying
you, I fancy, and wasting words in unavailing disquisition.
I hear my uncle’s step without, moreover;
permit me, I will join him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold yet a moment,” replied the old man, kindly,
“and let me say this to you now, while we are alone,
which I may perchance lack opportunity to say hereafter.
Your mother’s son, Durzil Olifaunt—for so I
shall ever call you, and so by <span class='it'>his</span> last words you are
entitled to be called—can never weary me. Your
welfare will concern me ever—what interests you will
interest me always, and next to my own son I shall
hold you nearest and dearest to this old heart at all
times. Now leave me if you will—yet hold! tell me
before you go, what I am fain to learn concerning
your good uncle—the knowledge shall perchance save
painful explanation, perchance grave misunderstanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that I know is at your service,” answered the
young man, in a calmer and milder tone than he had
used heretofore—for he was, in truth, much moved
and softened by the evident feeling of the old cavalier;
“but let me thank you first for your kindly offers,
which, should occasion offer, believe me, I will test as
frankly as you have made them nobly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his latter words Miles St. Aubyn made no answer,
except a grave inclination of his head, for his
mind was preoccupied now by thoughts of very different
import—was fixed, indeed, on days long passed,
and on old painful memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This girl,” he said at length, “this fair young girl
whom I saw here last night, is she—is she your sister?
I think you had a sister—yet this fair child hath not
Alicia’s hair, nor her eyes—who is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God was most good in that,” answered the seaman,
with much feeling, “he took my sister to himself, even
before my mother pined away. A man’s lot is hard
enough who is the son of shame—a woman’s is intolerable
anguish. Theresa is my uncle’s child—his
only child. His love for her is almost idolatry, and
were it altogether so, she deserves it all. Lo! there
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
she passes by the casement—was ever fairer face or
lovelier figure? and yet her soul, her innocent and artless
soul, has beauties that as far surpass those personal
charms, as <span class='it'>they</span> exceed all other earthly loveliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You love her,” said the cavalier, looking quickly
upward, for he had been musing with downcast eyes,
while Durzil spoke, and had not even raised his lids to
gaze upon Theresa as she passed through the garden.
“You love this innocent and gentle child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man’s cheek burned crimson, ashamed
that he should have revealed himself so completely to
one who was almost a stranger. But he was not one
to deny or disguise a single feeling of his heart,
whether for good or for evil, and he replied, after a
moment’s pause, with an <a id='falter'></a>unfaltering and steady voice,
“I <span class='it'>do</span> love her, more than my own soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she,” asked the old knight, “does she know,
does she return your affection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the sailor hesitated, “Women, they say,” he
replied, at length, “know always by a natural instinct
when they are beloved, and therefore I believe she
<span class='it'>knows</span> it. For the rest, she is always most affectionate,
most gentle, nay, even tender. Further than this, I
may not judge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” exclaimed a faint voice from the bed, at
this moment. “Is that you, father?” and Jasper St.
Aubyn opened his eyes, languid yet from the heavy
slumber into which the opiate had cast him, and raised
himself up a little on his pillow, though with a slow
and painful motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” cried the old man, hurrying to the side
of the bed, “my own boy, Jasper, how fare you now?
You have slept well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So well,” answered the bold boy, “that I feel
strong enough, and clear enough in the head, to be up
and about; but that whenever I would move a limb,
there comes an accursed twinge to put me in mind that
limestone rock is harder than bone and muscle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, as soon as the old cavalier’s attention
was diverted by the awakening of his own son
from his trance-like slumber, Durzil Bras-de-fer, as he
called himself, and as I shall therefore call him, left
the room quietly, and a few minutes afterward might
have been seen, had not the eyes of those within the
chamber been otherwise directed, to pass the casement,
following the same path which had been taken by
Theresa Allan a little while before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to have a great deal to say lately about
this Miss Hattie Atherton,” said my brother, looking
up from his book as I entered the parlor, after escorting
to the door a friend who had been making me a
morning call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said I, “I hope you have no objection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Objection—no indeed. But what is there in Miss
Hattie, that you all like so much? Your friends have
been perfectly absorbed in admiration of her for the
last three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you knew her you would not wonder that we
are all glad to have her at home again. She has been
absent four years at a boarding-school, and as she is
reported to be wonderfully accomplished her return
makes quite a sensation in our quiet circle. That is
the reason you have heard her name so frequently
mentioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A regular paragon of boarding-school accomplishments,
I suppose,” said Fred, with his most scornful
sneer. “She doesn’t know a cow from a sheep—works
worsted dogs—paints in colors <span class='it'>excessively
watery</span>—considers her father and mother quite countrified
and vulgar—and knows enough of the languages
to Frenchify her name into Harri<span class='it'>ette</span>, or into the more
unmeaning diminutive of H-a-t-t-i-e.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are really savage,” replied I, laughing, “but,
my good sir, you are quite mistaken in your enumeration,
for though she had adopted the diminutive of her
somewhat stately name, she is innocent of working
worsted dogs, and she rejoices in the knowledge that
of the two animals, the cow is the largest. Really,
Fred, she is a very lovely girl, perfectly unaffected,
and exulting like a freed bird to visit again her old
haunts,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, she is one of that sort, is she? Raves of nature
and falls on her knees to a pigweed. For my part,
I could never imagine why a boy wasn’t just as natural
as an alder bush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are really impertinent, Fred, to talk so about
my friends,” said I, a little vexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg your pardon, sis; but you may depend upon
it, all boarding-school girls belong to one of two classes—the
smart and affected, or the soft and sentimental.
You, my dear Mary, are the only one I ever knew to
pass the ordeal without being spoiled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which escape, I presume, you impute entirely to
liberal share of advice bestowed by my wise
brother. I am quite provoked with you, for your unsparing
sarcasms on women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if they were only all like you,” replied Fred,
rising to come to me, and then falling back on the sofa
with a growl at the pain the attempt had caused his
sprained <a id='ank'></a>ankle. Gentle reader, that sprain, which had
confined him four days to the sofa, was the sole reason
why my good-natured, sensible brother was so “uncommon”
cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause, during which Fred cut his nails
and I sewed most industriously. “I think,” said he
at length—but what he thought was lost forever to the
world, for at that moment the door opened and Hattie
entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak of angels and one sees their wings,” said I,
as I rose to welcome her. “You have come just in
time to verify the proverb, for we have been speaking
of you.” Fred gave me a beseeching glance. He did
not know of a plan I had formed, which was quite inconsistent
with any attempt to prejudice Miss Atherton
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope angels don’t tear their wings as badly as I
have torn my shawl. I have come to you for aid, and
you see I carry a flag of distress,” replied Hattie,
holding out her shawl that had one corner nearly torn off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you get such a rent in it?” exclaimed I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been paying a visit to your friend, Murray,
and caught it on a nail in his door,” said she laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world <a id='were'></a>were you doing at Murray’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went down to see his child. When I looked out
of my window this morning, I was horrified to see that
hop pole, whose graceful clusters we were admiring
yesterday, lying on the ground, and shorn of its glories.
On inquiring the cause of this outrage, I found that
Murray went to our house last evening for some hops
to make a tea for a sick child, and mother told him to
get some from this pole. In doing so, he managed,
with Irish dexterity, to throw it down directly across
the bed of <a id='dahl'></a>Dahlias.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your beautiful <a id='dahl2'></a>Dahlias—what a pity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was very sorry, but fortunately they are not all
destroyed. I thought the poor man must have been in
desperate haste to do such a thing, and so I went to see if
the child were dangerously sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those Murrays are protegés of mine, but I didn’t
know that any of them were sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child seems to be threatened with a fever, but
I made them give it a warm bath, and put baths of
hops on its head and feet, and before I left, it was quite
relieved. I staid to superintend the operations, lest
they should not do it properly, for I fancy they are not
accustomed to the use of water. To be sure, dirt is
the native element of that class—but aren’t they uncommonly
dirty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they are,” replied I. “Last winter I asked
Mrs. Murray why she didn’t wash the children before
she put on some new clothes I had provided for them,
and she opened her eyes in astonishment. ‘Sure
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
ma’am,’ said she, ‘sure and the dirt keeps ’em warm
when they’ve nothin’ else to kiver ’em.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose she thinks the same reason applies in
summer by the rule of contraries, for they were none
of them very clean, and I thought they were rather
alarmed at the sight of a tubfull of water. Murray asked
if I “wasn’t afeard the child ’ud cotch cold,” but he
says he thinks “hops is werry good things,” and she
imitated the deep guttural tones of our gardener with
a perfection that was perfectly startling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quite a doctress,” said Fred, when he had
done laughing—“can’t you prescribe for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think patience and resignation—an ounce
each, thoroughly compounded—would be the most
necessary remedy for a sprain,” replied Harriet—and
the conversation turned on other subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We examined the shawl, and pronounced it unmendable
and I offered to lend her my mantilla. “I will accept
it,” said she, “if you will yourself accompany it
and assist me in making some purchases this morning.
Sally Murphy, who has lived with us so long, is about
being married, and father intends furnishing her house
for her. It is a small tenement with only four rooms,
but it will be all her own, and she would not be more
delighted with a palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was soon ready, and we walked to the cabinet-makers,
who was delighted to furnish what we wanted,
and then to that “omnium gatherum,” yclept, “the
dry goods store,” where we found every thing necessary
for our purpose, from the lace for the bride’s
dress to the carpet that was to adorn her “keeping-room.”
“These are my part of the wedding presents,”
said Hattie. “I earned the money—you know
how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that I had a plan in view, in which my
brother and Hattie were to be the principal actors, and
you will readily perceive that though not much given
to meddling with the affairs of other people, I was
sufficiently feminine in my tastes to be something of a
matchmaker. Notwithstanding his fine intellectual
powers and considerable knowledge derived from men
and books, Fred had always been exceedingly deficient
in the ability to say and do those graceful nothings that
are the usual stepping-stones to an acquaintance between
ladies and gentlemen, and this, added to a certain
bashfulness that frequently attends a proud, sensitive
nature, had kept him from finding any intimate
friends among the ladies he had met in his college life,
and in his subsequent wanderings over the world.
Unfortunately, too, for my matrimonial schemes in his
behalf, he was provokingly contented with the prospect
of being an old bachelor; and since his establishment
in our village, had confined his visits to a few
married ladies who were vastly superior in cultivation
of mind to any of the unmarried ones of our acquaintance.
Thus with a handsome person, and more
than ordinary powers of pleasing, had he chosen to
exert them, my brother had passed to the shady side
of thirty, without having his large, warm heart stirred
by a deeper emotion than the quiet love excited by
the home circle. I was determined this state of things
should not endure much longer, and to Harriet I looked
for aid in breaking the spell of indifference that was
consigning him to the lonely and selfish existence of a
confirmed old bachelor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some weeks after the morning on which my story
opens, Fred invited me to walk with him to one of his
favorite places of resort—a grove that was situated
about a mile from the village. The purple light of
sunset was thrown like a glory over the surrounding
hills, and fell upon the bosom of the river which,
foaming in successive rapids through most of its course,
here spread out in a broad, deep current, as it swept
with graceful curve between its steep wooded banks.
Following the path that led down the bank, we came
out from the shadow of the trees into a point of land
that, jutting out into the river, was covered with a soft
greensward. A willow grew on its extremest verge,
and on a flat rock under its overhanging branches
Hattie Atherton was seated, with her sketch-book on
her knee. Her hat lay beside her on the grass, and
the wind sweeping back the long, shining curls that
usually hung over her face, revealed her broad, intellectual
brow, and the perfect contour of her features,
while her slight, delicate figure was relieved against
the dark trunk of the tree. So absorbed was she in
her occupation that she did not know of our approach
till we were beside her, and I had taken her book to
show Fred her accurate drawing of the view before
us. She started up with a slight blush, and turning to
my brother said, with a low silvery laugh,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ridicule romantic school girls, Mr. Stanley;
and as I presume you think I look very much like one at
this moment, I must tell you how I happened to be
here. Father told me to-day that the course of the
M—— railroad has been altered, and it will pass directly
along this bank, so that our beautiful grove will
be spoiled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was our indignation at the idea of this invasion,
and when we had exhausted almost every expression
in the language, Fred declared he would get up a remonstrance
and defeat their sacrilegious purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be of no use,” said Hattie. “It is the
march of improvement, and we must submit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse than the march of the Goths and Vandals,”
exclaimed Fred, wrathfully; “the idea of sacrificing
these grand old trees to the whims of a few railroad
contractors—it is too bad, for the other route will be
more convenient for everybody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt sorry enough, as you may imagine,” replied
Hattie. “I have spent so many happy hours here that
I determined to sketch the view from this point before
the measuring-rod or the steam-engine should disturb
its quiet beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your pencil has immortalized it; how perfectly
you have copied the flickering light that falls on
the smooth, dark waters, through those overhanging
trees. Really, Miss Atherton, I shall be exceedingly
obliged to you for a copy of this picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have one,” said Hattie, frankly. “I
intended making a picture from this, and giving the
drawing to Mary, for I know she loves this scene as
much as I do. I have so many pleasant associations
connected with it, that I feel as if I were to part with
an old friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can realize your feelings,” replied Fred, “for I,
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
too, have loved to listen on this spot to the many voices
of nature. How often have I sat beneath these trees
to watch the daylight fade from the hills, and the
twilight throw its shadows over the landscape, seeming
to descend lower and lower till they rested on the
bosom of the river, and I could see nothing but the
white foam gleaming through the dark, where it falls
over the rocks away yonder. Then the low, thrilling,
whispering of the wind among the pines, and the melancholy
scream of the night-hawk—I declare they
have made me quite poetical, as you see,” he added,
smiling, and slightly embarrassed at having been thus
betrayed out of his usual composure, which embarrassment
was not at all relieved by meeting Hattie’s
large dark eyes fixed on him with an expression of
wonder and gratification. Perhaps it was this <span class='it'>mauvais
honte</span>—perhaps it was the argumentative spirit which
had occasioned us to give him in the family the soubriquet
of “the opposing member”—that gave so
singular a turn to this sentimental conversation, when
at this moment, in turning over the leaves of her book,
Fred found a slip of paper covered with verses of
Harriet’s composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you write poetry, too!” said he, looking up at
her with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, give it to me—I wouldn’t have you read it
for the world,” exclaimed she, springing forward with
such evident distress that he reluctantly relinquished
the manuscript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be afraid of his criticism, for he writes
poetry sometimes,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do</span> you?” said Hattie, incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” answered my brother; “everybody
does now-a-days. In the class from which I graduated
at college, there were forty-five, of which forty
wrote poetry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrote <span class='it'>verses</span>, you mean,” said Hattie, demurringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is very little difference. The Horatian
maxim, ‘<span class='it'>Poeta nascitur non fit</span>,’ which has so long
been thought to countenance a distinction, simply
means that men and women who write poetry, like
other men and women, are ‘born.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose, then,” replied Hattie, humoring the
idea, “that the doctrine that poets were obliged to
gallop up the sides of a steep mountain in Greece, on
a vicious nondescript called Pegasus, is to be considered
wholly metaphorical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so,” said Fred. “Pegasus is now a mere
omnibus horse, and timid people need no longer be
afraid of entering the coach lest they should get a kick
from the rampant animal, or be thrown into the depths
of Helicon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctrine of inspiration is also exploded,” said
I, laughing. “Burns used to compose some of his nice
little sonnets while engaged in the groveling occupation
of ploughing, and if any thing more elaborate than
usual was wanting, he took a glass of Scotch whisky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Byron, too,” continued Fred, “wrote under the
influence of gin; and it is said of Wordsworth, considered
by the Lake school the greatest of modern
poets, that he had an assistant feeding him with bread
and butter while he was writing the ‘Excursion.’
Whoever, then, can drink whisky and gin, or as
coming within the circle of the ‘pledge,’ can eat bread
and butter, need fear no lack of inspiration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How ridiculous!” exclaimed Hattie. “What
would these great immortals think, could they hear
your nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immortals! there is another false idea that should
be given up by all sensible men. Every thing else
that is made is made for some object, and its excellence
is determined by its fitness for that object—why
shouldn’t it be so with poetry. Cheese, for instance,
in Connecticut, is made with especial reference to the
time of its consumption, and one kind is labeled ‘to
be eaten immediately,’ another, ‘in one year,’ ‘two
years,’ and so on. So with poetry. Some of it is
better to be kept some years and go down to posterity
like ‘Paradise Lost’ and Shakspeare, that were not
much esteemed at first, you know; other kinds, more
fit for present consumption, may be read by moonlight,
cried over, and applied to other purposes of poetry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remind me,” said I, “of a definition I heard
the other day, which said, ‘poetry is only pleasant,
metrical, musical, writing which amuses and astonishes
one’s friends, makes one’s enemies bite their lips for
envy, and may be counted on the fingers.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very good,” replied my brother, “but the
easiest way to make poetry is to take prose and turn
it. I was quite surprised, at an instance of this, I
found yesterday, in reading Napier’s History of the
Peninsula War. He had been describing the battle of
<a id='corr'></a>Corunna, and in speaking of the death of Sir John
More, he says, very nearly in these words: ‘it was
thought best to retreat without waiting for the break
of day. The body of Sir John was hurriedly deposited
in the earth, near the rampart, without music or even
a farewell shot being fired over his grave.’ Mr. Wolfe
has immortalized himself, as it is called, by turning
this account into verse; and just notice how closely
he has followed the prose original:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>It is</span> strikingly like,” said Hattie, “not even the
usual descriptive adjectives, and very little amplification.
That shows how easily pieces of poetry of great
celebrity may have been written. Perhaps you and I
may one day be famous. I have often thought how a
pensive man, looking at the water in this river during
a mild fall of snow, might say very naturally, in thinking
of the transitoriness of the pleasures of this world,</p>

<p class='noindent'>and yet be unconscious that he had uttered a beautiful

<p class='pindent'>“So, too,” said Fred, “any one who has ever cooked

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Hattie, when our laugh had subsided,

<p class='pindent'>After we had left Hattie at her own door, and were
proceeding homeward, Fred broke out in his most
earnest tone. “That Miss Atherton is a very nice
girl; what an intellectual face she has—have you seen
any of her poetry—does she write much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—you have read some of it, which she has
published anonymously, (but this is a great secret, remember,)
and her motive in doing so is as honorable
to her heart as the verses are to her poetical powers.
You know Mr. Atherton lavishes his wealth upon his
children without bounds, and Hattie says it does not
seem very benevolent for her to give away her father’s
money, so she devotes the proceeds of her literary
labors to purposes of charity. She is very kind to the
poor; I wish you could see how their faces brighten
at her approach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done! that is what I like in a woman. She
is really a very sensible girl,” replied my brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if she does write her name H-a-t-t-i-e,” said
I, with a sly glance. Fred pinched my arm, but said
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed on, and I was satisfied that my brother
had found out “what there was to like in Hattie
Atherton;” but a proud man deeply in love is the most
timid of mortals, and he sped but slowly in his wooing.
His favorite books were offered for her perusal; and
long evenings were spent in arguments upon questions
of metaphysics and philosophy, and though Hattie had
sufficient strength of intellect to sustain her share of the
conversation creditably, she was too much impressed
with awe of Fred’s menial abilities to feel perfectly
at ease while he was thus drawing forth the powers of
her mind; and, mistaking her dignity and slight reserve
of manner for indifference or aversion, he dared not
betray the strong affection with which she inspired
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, late in the summer, as I was sitting
alone in the twilight, Fred entered hastily, and throwing
himself into a chair, exclaimed, “I have just heard
very bad news—do you know—have you seen Harriet
to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—what has happened? Tell me, for mercy’s
sake,” said I, half frightened out of my wits at the sight
of his pale face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Atherton has failed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is that all,” replied I, with a feeling of relief
on knowing that nothing dreadful had befallen my
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All!” retorted Fred. “I should think that was
enough. It will nearly kill the old man, he has such
an overwhelming horror of debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did it happen?” said I, rising and putting on
my bonnet as I spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going over there? I will go with you,
and tell you about it on the way,” replied Fred, throwing
my shawl around me, and giving me his arm.
The story was soon told. The loss of a ship which
was wrecked without insurance some months before,
had somewhat embarrassed him, and the sudden
failure of two large mercantile firms in Boston, with
whom he was connected had completed the ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we approached the house through the garden, I
proposed that we should go in through one of the
parlor windows, which opened upon a grass-plot, and
formed a convenient entrance in that direction, of
which we had frequently availed ourselves. Never
shall I forget the sight which presented itself as we
stood before the window. Mrs. Atherton was reclining
on the sofa, sobbing bitterly. Mr. Atherton
was seated in an arm-chair, his face buried in his hands,
and his whole frame shrunk and collapsed, as if beneath
a weight of shame and agony. Harriet stood
beside him, bathing his head and raising with her
smooth, white fingers, the gray locks he had pulled
over his brow. The light which fell full on her face,
showed that she had been weeping violently; but now
there was a faint smile on her trembling lips, and she
was talking earnestly. We could not hear what she
said, but the tones were full of encouragement, and
her attitude and expression betokened firmness and
hope. As we gazed, the old man suddenly uncovered
his face, and throwing his arms around her neck, drew
her mouth down to his, and kissed her fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will not intrude here,” said my brother.
There was a strange huskiness in his voice, and I felt
his whole frame tremble as it did when he was strongly
moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We walked slowly home again and talked sadly of
the misfortune that had befallen our friends—of their
plans of quiet happiness that must be given up—of
their munificent charities that must be now contracted,
and of the anxieties and embarrassments which would
<a id='har'></a>harass that honorable old man, but when I said that
Lizzy must come home from school, and George must
discontinue his studies, Fred replied resolutely that
“It must not be;” and when we entered the house, he
seated himself before the writing-desk and commenced
a letter. Having occasion to cross the room as he
was closing it, I took a sister’s liberty to peep over his
shoulder, and saw—“So, my dear fellow, do not think
of leaving, but draw on me for whatever funds you
may require.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fortnight elapsed, during which I saw little of
Harriet. In his professional capacity, as a lawyer,
Fred was busy most of the time with Mr. Atherton,
canvassing the business—settling accounts and making
assignments; and it was a season of mental torture to
the ruined father which could hardly have been borne
had it not been for the gentle ministrations of his
daughter. She it was who nerved her invalid mother
to meet calmly their change of circumstances, and to
aid her in consoling the care-worn, haggard man,
whose sorrow they so deeply shared. The sight of
her lovely face beaming with cheerfulness and affection,
the sound of her low musical voice, as she sung
the songs he loved, or repeated to him words of religious
faith and consolation, seemed to operate like a
charm in driving away the cares that haunted him, and
gradually her firmness and courage were imparted to
him, and he was enabled to lift up his head once more
and hope for better days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early one morning Hattie entered the room where
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
we were sitting at breakfast, with a face so much
more joyful than she had for some time worn, that I
knew she must have some good news to communicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, indeed, so,” said she, in reply to my inquiry.
“I came to tell some news, and also to beg your
assistance for to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am at your service,” I answered; “but first tell
me what has happened to please you so much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must premise,” replied she, “what you already
know, that on settling up his affairs, father has found
that he can pay every cent he owes, and we shall
have our dear old house and garden left; and as father
has a thousand dollars a year from his land agency,
we shall be able to get along quite comfortably. But
in order to do so, Lizzy must leave school and George
must help support himself for the next eighteen months
which elapse before his studies are finished. Now
you know he inherits mother’s delicate constitution,
and his health is too feeble to allow him to apply himself
as closely as will be necessary if he is to earn his
own support. Father has a sort of nervous horror of
his getting into debt, (and George is as particular as
father is on that point,) so, to make my story short,”
she added, hesitating a little, while a bright blush suddenly
suffused her face, “<span class='it'>I</span> am going to support them,
and father can keep the old homestead⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You support them—how?” we both exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through the kindness of my old teacher, Miss
W——. Lizzy mentioned in her last letter that Miss
Foster, who has so long taught drawing and music at
the Seminary, had left to be married, and their present
teacher was not considered competent. So I
wrote the day after our misfortune came, without
saying any thing to father, and applied for the situation,
and this morning I received an answer, filled with
the most flattering expressions of kindness, and offering
very liberal terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not seriously mean that you intend teaching?”
said my brother, in a tone that deepened the
flush on Hattie’s cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I do. Why should I not make my
acquirements available. I intend to ‘<span class='it'>improve my
talents</span>,’ and as that old-fashioned Jewish coin is not
current in this country, I must exchange it for something
that will pass more readily. I am quite delighted,
too, with the terms Miss W—— offers me, though I
fear I shall not be worth so much money. She says,
if I will let part of the salary go to pay Lizzy’s school-bills,
she will give me five hundred dollars a year, on
condition that I engage to remain two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be about four hundred dollars in money,”
said I, musingly; “yes, that is quite good pay, to be
sure; but, then, what will your father and mother do
without you for two years—have they consented to
your plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have, after some opposition. They will be
very much alone, but I shall depend upon your kindness
to cheer their lonely hours, and your brother will
perhaps spend an evening with father occasionally,”
added she, glancing timidly at Fred, who was drumming
on the table with a very dissatisfied air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you leave?” asked my mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow,” she answered, rising; “and that reminds
me that I have not yet told you, Mary, that I
came to request your assistance to-day in making my
final preparations. I did not expect to go so soon, and
have many little things to arrange before I leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you go to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In order to be there at the commencement of the
next term—you will come, wont you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I promised to be with her in a short time, and she
departed; and Fred, after putting salt into his coffee,
and mustard on his bread, in a vain attempt to finish
his breakfast, took his hat in desperation, and went
out after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Atherton,” said he earnestly, as he overtook
her, “let me persuade you to give up this scheme—we
can’t spare you for two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite astonished at opposition from you,
Mr. Stanley,” said Hattie, in some confusion at his
earnest manner. “It is but a few weeks since we
had that long talk about woman’s duties and powers
of usefulness. You remember what you said then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but with you,” replied Fred, in a low tone,
“with you it is ‘to gild refined gold, to paint the lily.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long silence followed, for both were too much
agitated to speak, when Fred repeated, “Do give up
this plan—there is no need of it. I have written your
brother to draw on me for any amount he may need to
complete his education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind,” said Hattie, tremulously, and
her soft eyes were filled with a dewy light, as for a
moment they met his impassioned gaze. Just then
they reached the garden-gate, and in attempting to unlatch
it at the same time, their hands met. The touch
thrilled through each frame like an electric shock.
Fred took her hand and drew it within his arm as
they proceeded up the walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could only persuade you,” said he, “how
gratified I am to be of service to you. If you could
have the faintest adequate idea how necessary is your
presence to my happiness—how I have lived for weeks,
months, only in the hope that I might one day tell you
how fervently my whole soul loves you. Oh, dear
Miss Atherton, is it all in vain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no reply, but the small, trembling hand
that rested on his arm, placed itself in the hand that
lay near it, and nestled there, as if it would cling forever.
A glad, hopeful smile sprung to his lips.
“Harriet—dear Harriet, you will let me love you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again those expressive eyes were raised to his, and
her heart spoke through them, as her low dear tones
answered, “I will love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will not leave me—you will be my wife—you
will give me the right to assist your brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some time hence, but not now. You must not
strive to break my resolution. I trust in you fully, and
the words you have just spoken, are to me like sunshine
breaking through the clouds that have enveloped
my life; but for Lizzy’s sake, and for George’s, it is
best that I should not relinquish my purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered the house and sat down together. All
the barriers of doubt and distrust that had separated
them were removed, and these two full, strong hearts,
were revealed to each other. With all the eloquence
of affection, Fred endeavored to convince her that
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
it was not her duty to leave the home that was now
more than ever dear to her; but the gentle girl was
firm in her noble resolve, and at length her pleadings
won from him a reluctant consent to its fulfillment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two years, which had seemed so long in the
prospective, passed rapidly away, as time always does
when one is in the steady performance of duty.
Hattie’s visits at home were short and unfrequent, but
she won the admiration of her pupils. Lizzy was at
school with her, and Fred found so much business to
compel him to visit the city, that he was considered
quite a public benefactor by certain postage-saving
acquaintances, who besieged our door with inquiries
when Mr. Stanley would go to B——, and would he
take a package?</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the evening before the wedding-day. The
sisters had returned three months before, and George
had been some time at home, and was soon to be ordained
as pastor over the church where for generations
his fathers had worshiped. Having assisted Lizzy
in arranging the bridal paraphernalia for to-morrow
morning’s ceremony, I went down stairs to bid Hattie
good-night before I went home. She was standing by
the window, with her head leaning on Fred’s shoulder.
One of his arms was around her, and with the other
he was holding back the curtain that the brilliant moonlight
might fall full on the beautiful face that was raised
to his with an expression of confiding affection. A
sudden recollection flashed upon my mind, and crossing
the room, I threw my arms around them as they
stood together, and said to my brother, “Fred, <span class='it'>have
you</span> found out what there is to like in Hattie Atherton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found,” replied Fred, drawing her fondly to
his heart, “that there is every thing in her to like except
her name; she will change that to-morrow, and
then she will be perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Wilson was an only child. Her parents
were exceedingly wealthy; and, though possessing
extended landed estates, they were as parsimonious in
hoarding up riches as though they were only in moderate
circumstances. Mr. Wilson was rather aristocratic
in his manners, yet, in many respects, he was
quite liberal to those of his neighbors who were not as
fortunate as himself in accumulating property. He
was a gentleman of great influence, around whom
gathered the elite of Cincinnati—whose favor was
courted and sought by the wealthy and great. In his
earlier days Mr. Wilson had laid out the rules which
were to govern him through the world, and, in whatever
circumstance in life, he fully resolved to abide by
the course he had adopted for his guidance. He had retired
from the active capacity of a business man; and
yet, whenever he found an opportunity for speculating,
he was just the man to engage in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the time our story commences, the fever of
speculation in the Western States raged to a marvelous
extent. The excitement was great, and many had invested
their whole patrimony in the speculation, with
the ardent assurance that they would become immensely
wealthy. But, alas! their expectations were
but “castles in the air;” for the excitement soon subsided,
and those who had invested their all in purchasing
land, now found, to their great astonishment,
that they had lost all they possessed. Many who were
independent one day, and had the brightest anticipations
of the future, the next were penniless and destitute,
not knowing where or how to procure a sustenance
for their families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the most unfortunate in this respect was Mr.
Wilson. He had invested all—even to the last dollar—of
his immense possessions; he had bought lands at an
exorbitant price; but he was perfectly satisfied that in
the speculation he would make his thousands. His
wife and daughter remonstrated against his entering so
largely into the meshes of the excitement, and of involving
himself to so great an extent; but he was too
deeply resolved upon making money to pay the least
regard to their remonstrances. He endorsed largely
for others, and appeared lost in the agitation which existed.
Speculation was the all-absorbing topic—with
him it was a sort of magic, which usurped his entire
thoughts, and, to a great degree, restrained his manly
virtues. But soon his dreams and anticipations received
a relapse, the effect of which had a serious impression
upon his feelings. The day of speculation
had passed, and the entire capital which Mr. Wilson
had invested, was gone! He had lost all! he was reduced
to poverty! Many others shared the same fate.
Wealthy citizens were stripped of all their property;
many of whom, who had not lost all in speculating,
were sufferers from the evil consequences of endorsing
for others. In short, a depression of business ensued
seldom witnessed in a commercial city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reduced to want, Mr. Wilson’s ambition was gone!
his pride preventing him from engaging in any ordinary
business; and his constitution too feeble for manual
labor, he felt keenly sensible of the unpleasantness of
his situation. He knew not what to do! His splendid
mansion—the home of his childhood, whose hallowed
associations filled his heart with happiness—had been
given up, to satisfy the demands of the law; his furniture
was sold; and still unliquidated claims pressed
daily and heavily upon him for payment. Friends who,
in the days of his prosperity, flocked to his hospitable
board, now shunned him, as one whom they regarded
as their inferior, both in point of wealth and respectability.
Mr. Wilson observed the change with the
keenest sense of injustice, and now felt how painful it
was to be <span class='it'>thought</span> inferior to his fellow-man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary was a girl of uncommon pretensions, whose
amiable disposition and beauty attracted to her side a
host of admirers, who, in their prosperous days, sought
to rival each other for her hand—among whom was
Charles Tomlinson, the son of a wealthy merchant of
Cincinnati. Charles was a young man of rare talents,
prepossessing deportment, and affable disposition. He
possessed all the qualities of a noble, generous-hearted
man; but, notwithstanding the purity of his daily
“walk and conversation,” he had imbibed many vague
sentiments in regard to the Bible and the precepts
taught in that holy book. Mary observed this, and felt
pained to see so much talent wasted in useless attempts
to prove the Bible false; but yet she loved him. Their
attachment daily grew stronger, until they were betrothed,
and the day appointed for the consummation of
their vows. Before, however, the time for their marriage
arrived, Mr. Wilson’s misfortune came, the tendency
of which was an entire revolution in the feelings
of Mr. Tomlinson. He now resolved that he
would <span class='it'>not</span> marry her, because her father had failed,
and, in all probability, would never be worth a dollar
again. With this resolution on his mind, he was at a
loss in what way to acquaint her of his determination,
or how he could honorably release himself from his
engagement. He had too little fortitude to unmask his
change of sentiment to her, personally; and to do so
by letter would betray a want of manliness, which he
had the reputation of possessing. In the midst of this
trying situation, he called to his assistance a friend, in
whom he had placed the utmost confidence, and to
whom he had entrusted the transaction of much important
business. To this friend Mr. Tomlinson gave
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
instructions how to proceed, directing him at the same
time to use the utmost caution in the information he
wished to convey. His name was Samuel Gordon.</p>

<p class='line' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“She seldom smiled—and when she did,</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;&ensp;It was so sad, subdued, and brief,</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:0.9em;'>As though her mourning heart she’d chide,</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;&ensp;And strove to smile away its grief.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The attachment between Tomlinson and Miss Wilson,
thus far, had been secretly kept from her parents,
they preferring to make it known but a few weeks
previously to their marriage-day. But Mrs. Wilson, with
the watchfulness of a mother, perceived their intimacy,
and, in a gentle manner, addressed her thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, for some time past I have noticed rather
more than a friendly intimacy between you and Mr.
Tomlinson, and, as a mother, I feel it my duty to give
you advice on the subject. I would not do aught to
give you pain; but I am not favorable to the addresses
of Mr. Tomlinson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilson, deeming it no longer prudent to keep
the truth of the matter concealed from her mother, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear mother, I hope you will forgive my rashness,
for we have long since been engaged. I hope you will
overlook my disobedience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their conversation was broken off by a quick ring
of the bell, and Mary hastened to the door to respond
to the call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a message from Mr. Tomlinson, and wish to
see Miss Wilson alone for a few moments,” said the
stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Miss Wilson. What is your business with
me, sir?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” he continued, “unfortunately to announce
to you that Mr. Tomlinson, since he has lost so much
in the misfortunes which have fallen on so many of the
citizens of this city, deems it, at present, a rash undertaking
to marry, while circumstances of such an aggravating
character continue. I think it would be better
for you to be as calm as possible, and wait with due
patience until a more favorable turn of fortune, which
I anticipate will not be very long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had an ice-bolt entered the heart of that young girl,
it could not have had a much greater effect. His words
fell upon her ears like the solemn knell of all her hopes;
for, since their misfortunes, she had fondly supposed
that her marriage with Mr. Tomlinson would, in a great
measure, retrieve the reputation of her father. She
could not believe that Mr. Tomlinson would be guilty
of such duplicity, and thought a stranger had imposed
upon her. But how he, stranger as he was,
knew any thing in regard to their engagement, was
something more than she could solve—an enigma
which cost her much anxiety and thought; for even
her parents, until that moment, had not known it. Her
mother saw the hectic flush mantle the cheek of her
child, and felt conscious that something serious would
be the consequence. That Mary loved Tomlinson was
unmistakable. She read it in the deep blue of her eyes;
she saw it in every lineament of her features; she discovered
it in all her actions; and, with the sympathy
of a mother’s own feelings, she endeavored to console
her in that, her “hour of need.” But the effect was
too much for her delicate constitution to bear. She
“loved not wisely, but too well;” and, day after day,
she sat pensively surveying the beautiful scenery before
her, and silently reflecting on her own unhappy
condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a lovely autumn evening, just as the sun was
shedding its last rosy beams on the tops of the surrounding
hills, Mary looked from her chamber window,
and drank in, at a glance, the golden glories of
expiring day, and thought how calm it would be for her
to die as sweetly as the sun was sinking to rest behind
the hills, so that her memory might live, like the beauteous
twilight, long after her frail body had mouldered
again to dust. She called her mother to her side, and
told her that she was dying! At such a beautiful hour,
when the day began to close, and shadows were no
longer broad-cast from the clouds, but were stretched
along the surface of the earth by the interception of a
tree, or hill-side, Mary breathed her last!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As these precious but fleeting scenes pass like sober
thoughts across the face of earth, or intermingle side
by side with gay and brilliant passages of light of equal
evanescence, making all tender and beautiful, which
otherwise had been lustrous and sparkling, they call up
within the heart the memory of the past; and by an
association we can scarcely trace, characters reappear
of friends who have passed away before us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended the life of Mary Wilson. Struck down
in the vigor and bloom of youth, this young maiden has
left many friends to mourn her loss. She was much
esteemed; so much so, that every personal defect was
forgotten in the charms of her spirit, with which she
imparted to her friends a look of kindness and a
blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town or borough of Harrisburg, the political
capital of Pennsylvania, lies on the <span class='it'>bank</span> of the Susquehanna,
about 107 miles west of Philadelphia. I
say on the <span class='it'>bank</span>, not the shore; for here a bold bluff
rises a few yards from the northern margin of the river,
and the town is, therefore, from ten to fifteen feet above
the stream—a fact of consequence to the inhabitants;
as the Susquehanna, which, in summer, may be easily
forded by children, will frequently, during the spring
freshets, rise from six to eight feet, threatening all upon
its borders. The houses are built only on the north
side of this front street, so as to face the river and
leave, besides the beautiful avenue, a handsome esplanade
in front of the town, overlooking the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few places can present a more delightful promenade
than this <span class='it'>front</span> of Harrisburg; and the writer hereof
has more than once sought to express his appreciation
of the walk and the gorgeousness of the views to be
enjoyed therefrom. The scene is ever fresh—ever delightsome,
to one who has an eye for the beautiful of
nature, and a heart to be warmed into the enjoyment
of that beautiful. No frequency of indulgence palls
the appetite here—no change of season diminishes the
attraction. Whether the stream murmurs round the
projecting rock and over masses of pebbles that mark its
bed and are visible in summer, or whether the current
dashes deep and bold, fed by the melting snows of the
upper mountains, it is beautiful; beautiful in its simple
exhibition—beautiful in its terrible grandeur. Whether
the setting sun steeps the current in liquid, tremulous
light, or the wild, tempestuous blasts of January heap
up the waters in dark and chaffing masses, all is beautiful;
and men go forth to gaze in quiet enjoyment on
the peaceful flow of July, or to enrich and stimulate
their feelings with the all-conquering power of the
down-rushing torrent of March.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indulging in dreamy pleasure one morning late in
June, while contemplating the loveliness of the scene,
I cast my eyes away to the mountains through which
the river forces its course a few miles above the town,
and was delighted to see the first evidences of the rising
sun in the yellow light that tinged the topmost peaks
of those mighty promontories, while heavy wreaths of
mist, engendered on the ground below, were rolling
upward, like giants anxious to bathe early in the sunlight—an
enjoyment that must have cost them existence,
or, perhaps, only present <span class='it'>visibility</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can now recall some of the reflections to which the
magnificent scene gave rise. Those children of the
mist, that tended upward, were they only imaginary
beings? only the workmanship of my fancy, upon
the crude materials that sprung up from the fens? or
were those misty shapes indeed the essential forms of
spirits, whose tendencies were upward—who, though
dragged downward by the grossness of their outward
covering, which affected its home and would abide in
its cold, dark birth-place, struggled upward to the light
and heat, and were released from the clogging properties
of the visible and the impure, while they put
on the invisible and the purified?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew the law of physics, by which the ascensive
power of matter is augmented by heat, and consequently
felt that some of those who were sleeping in
the vicinity, would have referred all those misty images
of the mountains to well known and always occurring
circumstances. I admit that natural causes produce
just such effects as the ascension of these wreaths of
mist. But may not He who enacts the laws by which
all these events occur, connect also the state, habits
and tendencies of some class of beings with the operation
of those laws? Because the sun gives light and
heat to the system of which it is the centre, because
we know that it riseth and goeth down, and because
we can calculate the influence of its light and heat
upon our planet, does it follow that the same body may

<p class='pindent'>I was calculating the effect upon one who should,
while standing on that mountain, venture to address
these wreathy forms, and find himself understood and
answered, when the presence of a person whom I had
once or twice seen, at the peep of dawn,</p>

<p class='noindent'>renewed a resolution of putting to him a question as to
the origin of a certain enclosure in the vicinity. There
was, between the upper bank and the edge of the
river, directly in front of the town, a small enclosure,
perhaps fifteen feet square, surrounded by a decaying
board fence, and having in it two miserably looking
Lombardy poplars, touched with all the squalidness of
decay which characterizes the <span class='it'>age</span> of that short-lived
tree. Brambles, too, had sprung up in the enclosure,
and they covered a small rising of the ground, with
some invisible emblems. My object was to know
why such a place was allowed in front of the town;
why it was made, and why thus continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said my friend, “is the grave of old Mr.
<span class='sc'>Harris</span>, for whom the town was named, long before
they thought of building the capitol yonder. But there
is a long story connected with the matter, and you can
learn the whole of it if you will call, with proper motives
and in a proper manner, upon a descendant of
the old patriarch who resides in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I saw in this man some signals of fancy, and I
felt determined to get the story out of him. But he professed
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
to be in too much haste; he had his day’s work
to perform, and he had almost forgotten the story. But
I persevered with him and obtained some account,
which, after eleven years, I put on paper, not venturing
to quote my friend for authority, telling the story
not exactly as ’twas told to me, but as I recollect and
reconstruct the narrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Harris was one of the pioneers of Pennsylvania.
He saw the country rich and beautiful before him, and
“went forth and stood and measured the earth” in and
around the place where now stands the borough which
bears his name. The beauty of scenery, the delicate
softness of the valley contrasting with the towering
summits of the mountains around, made the place exceedingly
desirable. He, like the men of his times,
had an eye for the beautiful, and a far-reaching ken
that took in the future with the present; and so he sat
down on the shores of the Susquehanna, on what was
then perhaps an island, though now a part of the main
land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Harris was a man of the world—I mean what I
say—he was emphatically a man of the world.
Calmly and coolly had he, in his youth, sat down to reflect
upon the policy which would best subserve the
purposes which he had in view; and, after mature deliberation,
he came to the conclusion that the precepts
of his mother were well founded, and that however
much the gay might ridicule, or the short-sighted neglect,
the rules which she had prescribed, and which
she had made him, in boyhood, follow—on the whole,
“to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly,”
would serve the affairs of a long life as well as they
would produce effects after death. So, Mr. Harris sat
down on the banks of the Susquehanna, an honest man
from habit—an honest man from principle; a Christian
by birth—a Christian by all his actions. He had nothing
Utopian in his views, nothing impracticable in
his plans. If he bought or sold, it was with a view to
his own advantage in the transaction, and neither
white man nor red man could outbargain him; but
either white man or red man would be welcome to all
that his wants required at his hands; and those who
failed to get one quart of meal more than he would
allow in trade, found no difficulty in procuring a peck
whenever their necessities appealed to his feelings of
charity rather than to his rule of business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The means of the founder of the settlement had
been somewhat diminished by an act of goodness,
which few could appreciate at the time. A stout black
man was about to be torn from his wife to be sent into
slavery at the South. The ability of the slave enhanced
his price, while his goodness of heart made the separation
more intolerable to him. The wife was free—should
she go into voluntary slavery in order to follow
her husband? and if she did, who could tell her that
the first inducement to the owner to sell her husband
might not result in a separation, which no sacrifice on
her part could prevent, nor could it mitigate the evils
thereof. In this state Pompey appealed to Mr. Harris;
he promised fidelity, industry and gratitude; Mr. Harris
saw that he could prevent misery, and he paid the
price of the man, and thus became his <span class='it'>owner</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Massa Harris,” said the delighted black, as he
saw the accomplishment of his heart’s desire, “I’ll do
something for this by and by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do, Pompey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know, massa; but guess ’twill come sometime
or other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pompey formed a part of Mr. Harris’s establishment
in his small settlement upon the Susquehanna,
and by his light heartedness and his labor, seemed to
repay all obligations which his purchase devolved upon
him. He had a song for the youngsters who visited
the place, and he could dance with the Indians that resided
a short distance above; and whether in the field
or at the mill, he was trustworthy, active, industrious,
and never for a moment did his worthy master find
cause to regret his purchase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done enough for to-day?” would Pompey inquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done more, Pompey, than I directed, and
you have done it well; and excepting your habit of
singing foolish songs, and dancing like a madman
among the Indians and squaws that come down from
the Juniata, I have been well compensated for your
cost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have not done <span class='it'>that</span>,” said Pompey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Pompey, that I require only the discharge
of ordinary duties; I do not expect you will
meet with any occasion for any extraordinary effort in
my behalf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, massa—it will come, bym’by, I <span class='it'>tell</span>
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peaceful, gentle manners of Mr. Harris had
their effect upon Pompey’s movements, but not to the
extent which the master desired. The servant was
honest, industrious, and did all the work that was required
at his hands, but he could not pretermit his
sport. The day of gloom closed with Pompey when
Mr. Harris saved him from the sale to the South and
the separation from his wife, and Pompey felt a sort of
devotion in his wild, irregular dances and his loud,
shrill singing. His spirits rose with every recollection
of the kindness, and, as he broke into a verse of some
favorite song or shuffled out upon the hard earth with
bare heels the time of a quickly moving tune, he felt
that he was only giving expression to gratitude for his
kind master; and who shall say that the offering of the
joyous black was not made acceptable above, by the
sincerity of the feelings in which it was presented?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a clear star-light evening of July, the moon
had not risen, and the planetary worlds above seemed
to magnify themselves in the absence of the great
source of day; a gentle draft of air down the stream
was felt, and occasionally a rustling among the foliage
was caused by the wind, augmented into a temporary
breeze. The whole bank of the river was covered
with tall forest trees, save where Mr. Harris’s little
settlement was placed. On a bold bluff, now washed
away, but which then jutted out into the stream, as if
for the site of some defensive works, stood a female.
She had been long looking up into the firmament, and
then casting her eyes around, as if expecting some
one to share with her the “contemplation of the starry
heavens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman stepped forward and looked
down upon the waters below her for some time, and
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
then murmured: “They are now, as in years past,
above and below—the glorious constellations shining
on, and year after year returning, with all their train
rich in their lustre, and surveying themselves in the
waters beneath. But <span class='it'>we</span> change. Year after year
passes, and my fathers’ race, if they appear at all, present
themselves in diminished numbers and in wasting
forms. The foot of the white man is on the soil, and
he treats us as he does the forest trees. Where he
finds our race convenient, he leaves them to perish for
want of communion with their like; where he needs
their lands, he strikes them down as cumberers of the
ground; and I, who love the race—<span class='it'>I</span> dwell among the
pale faces, in peace; nay, I dwell among them of
choice. I love their people, and I reverence the precepts
by which some of them are governed—by which
all profess to be guided. Oh, spirit of my fathers!
must all pass away like the wreaths of mountain
mist, and, as they fall, shall it be the disgrace of their
name that vice, and not vengeance, swept them from
the earth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what is this new principle which the whites
have infused into my soul—the means and condition of
future happiness? What is it that bids me forbear the
wish that I was a man—a chief among my fathers’
people, that I might chase the intruder from our hunting-grounds,
and restore to our nation the land which
was purchased by trinkets and baubles, costless to the
whites and useless to the red men? What is that
principle that <span class='it'>bids</span> me, nay <span class='it'>makes</span> me, pray for the
good of the whites around me, and look to the destruction
of my father’s race as a means of that good?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell. And the teachings of the whites
concerning the requirements of their own religion, become
dark and confused when they attempt to reconcile
their practice with their precepts; at least, those
who teach most do most confound. But Father Harris,
who has little to say, how good are all his <span class='it'>deeds</span>! how
like the shining of those stars upon the water is his
benevolence to my race! beautiful in itself, and reflected
in the hearts of the red men with constant
lustre. Oh, if all were like him! but then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what, Dahona?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interruption was caused by a young man who
had followed the speaker to a place of frequent resort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what, Dahona?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, William, nay, do not call me Dahona; at
least, do not call me thus in <span class='it'>this</span> place—do not call me
thus when you find me alone—when the wildness of
the scene begets wildness of thought, and the breeze
which comes down from the hunting-grounds of my
fathers, seems to fan into a flame the lingering sparks of
native fire which civilization, as yet, has not quenched.
Do not, by such a name, call up my almost buried
thoughts of those who owned these lands when the
white men were enjoying that which they stole from
their conquered enemies; do not tell me, in the midst
of these returning pangs of pride and regret—do not by
that name tell me, that I am the daughter of a chief
killed upon his own hills; and when I would calm
down those feelings of vengeance, which come with
longer intervals, do not, with the name of Dahona,
goad me on to those wishes which must be sinful, for
they are unjust to Father Harris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, my dear Rebecca, if all the whites
were like Father Harris, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not all like him. Those who taught me
to read and write, and who tried to teach me to pray,
are not like him. They talked of the equality of man,
and yet treated me as the child of a monster. Father
Harris knows that I am human, like himself, and he
treats me as if I was immortal, as he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, should not the virtues of such a man redeem
from censure a thousand offending whites?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps so, William—I think so now; but there
are times—moments like some which I pass alone on
this point of land—in which the virtues of that good
man seem to me a motive for vengeance upon <span class='it'>him</span>.
Were he like others, the red man could strike; were
he like others, <span class='it'>I</span> could strike; if, instead of kindness,
which demands gratitude, and constant care and parental
watchfulness, which beget affection, he had
treated me as other whites treat my race, it might
be long ere the hunting-fields of the tribe submitted
to the plough. But the virtues of the whites subdue
the feelings of the Indians, and the vices of the
whites destroy the race. And yet, William, Father
Harris, with all this virtue, forbids our union!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Forbids</span> it, Rebecca, but does not hinder it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not hinder it? Does he not hinder it by his refusal
to sanction it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May we not go down to the lower settlement and
be married, as others are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will that procure his consent, William?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but, of course, it will be followed by his pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, William, even the poor theology of my native
tribe forbids the hope of pardon for a sin committed in
the hope of pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he has no right, Rebecca, to prevent our happiness
by his refusal to sanction the union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has over me the right of a father, and shall
never complain of a want of obedience. I may suffer
by his refusal, but if he is wrong he must bear the consequences.
No, William, no. I have told you that I
would marry none other than you; but I will not
marry you without the consent of Father Harris while
he lives, with power to give or to withhold that consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His reasons are insufficient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, William, say not that; though he has not told
me his reasons, I think I comprehend them. In the
first place, you are the son of his old friend and relative;
can the strong prejudices of your race be appeased,
if you should marry the daughter of an Indian?
It is true that I was a princess; and the whites whom
I met at the school in the city, always appeared to
worship those of royal blood, and I do not know that
the crown of the parent country might not devolve
upon the head of a man or woman as black and as curly
as our Pompey, if such an one should, by the accidents
of taste and the favor of the right <span class='it'>creed</span>, fall into the
channel of succession by an admitted marriage. That
strong prejudice, I am persuaded, influences Father
Harris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
“But it does not influence <span class='it'>me</span>, Rebecca; and why
should it? Associated with the best of our people in
the city, you have acquired their habits; you have,
with all the delicacy of your sex, twice the learning
that can be boasted of by many of ours; and if⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, William; you mean by ‘<span class='it'>if</span>,’ that if I had
ceased to feel, and sometimes act, like an Indian, <span class='it'>then</span>—But
I have not ceased to feel and to act, <span class='it'>sometimes</span>,
like my father’s child; and all the learning which the
whites have imparted, seems only to enable me to appreciate
more correctly the sufferings and wrongs of
my people; and if it were not for the gentle teaching
of that Quaker woman—nay, the teaching rather of
the <span class='it'>spirit</span> by which she is influenced—I should, perhaps,
make my knowledge a means of vengeance.
But, William, there is another cause, founded on sound
policy, for the refusal of Father Harris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the daughter of a chief of a tribe that scarcely
thinks of peace; and when my father was tortured by
his conquering foes—tortured to death, but not to a
groan—and my mother was struck down by the hatchet
of a warrior of the tribe above us, I was redeemed
from captivity by Father Harris—saved from a miserable
death—treated, educated and loved by him as his
child. While I am here, it may be that the warriors
of my tribe will respect his settlement; if I should
marry you, the tribe above, always friendly, might
grow jealous of the connection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is more of worldly policy in that than Mr.
Harris is wont to exercise,” said William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us be content,” said Rebecca “with his decision
for the present. He who has always intended
right, cannot long persist in wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dialogue of the lovers became less and less argumentative,
and was soon changed from that of
an educated, high-minded woman and a deferential
young man, to the gentle intercourse of two lovers—more
pleasing to themselves, though perhaps less interesting
to my readers. The moon had risen, and the
light of its diminished form was dancing on the ripples
of the river, and lay broad and lovely upon the side of
the mountain above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that sound?” asked Rebecca, with evidence
of fear. “Surely some one is abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was only a deer, or some such animal, on the
other side of the river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, William, the deer does not move thus by
night, unless alarmed by the hunter or some animal.
Let us return; we may be injured, even on this side
the river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair withdrew to the little settlement; and as
they passed one of the out-houses, they discovered,
through the interstices of the logs of which it was
constructed, the white teeth and shining eyes of Pompey,
who, not having any love affair on hand, was very
willing to have a laugh at “Massa William,” or a little
knowing wink at Rebecca, the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca was soothed to repose by the quiet of her
conscience and the healthful, gentle influence of the
prayer with which she sanctified her little chamber—prayer
that included blessings upon the head of her
benefactor, her early friend and father—prayer that
expressed confidence and love for Him who was her
“Father in Heaven.” The noise of the river, hastening
downward in its eternal course, was lulling, and in
the strong light which the moon poured through the
little window of her chamber, the enthusiastic girl
seemed to find the forms of guardian angels; and she
sunk to sleep in the confidence that she was in the
care of Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And was she not? What but Heaven provided for
her the ample affection of Harris? What but Heaven
made his teachings operative upon her conduct? What
threw across the dark mind of the Indian girl the light
of Christian truth?—a light whose reflection was certainly
tinged with a portion of the hues of the object
which it reached, but which still was Christian light,
doing its perfect work and effecting, by constant operation,
the character, condition and habits of Rebecca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a short time before daylight that the
young sleeper, who had retired to rest in the consciousness
of Heaven’s guardianship, was alarmed by
loud cries, and on looking abroad she saw that one
building of the little hamlet was wrapped in flames,
while the wild yells of the savages told the poor girl
what was the cause of the danger, and left little doubt
as to its extent; and she knew, too, that the savage intruders
were the people of her own tribe. Scarcely
had she thrown a few clothes around her, and wrapped
herself about with a blanket from her bed, when the
voice of Pompey, as he passed her window, was
heard. One sentence only did the poor fellow utter:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save all the time you can, Miss Rebecca!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In two minutes more the little settlement was surrounded
by the savages. William, who had been
aroused later than the black, sought to save Mr. Harris,
but failed, and seeing no chance of escaping through
the line of Indians, he rushed into the room of Rebecca,
and opening a small door took refuge in a cellar beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, it was known, incurred little personal
risk. She was of the tribe of the invaders; and vengeance
upon the whites, and the spoliation of their
goods, were the objects of the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had William reached his hiding-place when
the chief of the small tribe of invaders presented himself
at the door of Rebecca’s room, and demanded
William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not in my room. Do you think men are to
be found in my bed-chamber?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A white man may be found any where in time of
danger,” said the savage. “But I do not care for the
fellow; I want to know where Harris has hidden his
goods—especially where he has concealed the rum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not keep his goods nor hide his rum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know where he hides them, and you shall
tell me, or I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or you will kill me—kill a woman! Brave chief!
Has the influence of the white man reduced our tribe
to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not threaten you, Dahona; but I will strike
where you can feel as keenly as on yourself. Tell me
where these goods are secreted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not; and you dare not take vengeance on
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Dahona, through yonder window!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
The girl turned her eye to the window, and by the
broad blaze of the burning building she saw a stake
erected, near the river, and numerous savages were
heaping around it quantities of wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—for Harris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman checked the exclamation which
was rising to her lip:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will release him if I will point out to you
the goods; you will do no personal injury to any one,
and spare the rest of the property?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian hesitated; but the lie which seemed to
struggle for utterance, against the habits of his race,
was spoken:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will spare all—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the people of the tribe—will they spare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a band of savages was seen conveying
Mr. Harris down to the stake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spirit of Rebecca was shaken. She did not
know, indeed, <span class='it'>where</span> any goods were concealed, and
the small amount which had been put aside was then
brought forward by some of the Indians, who were
more occupied with the rum they had secured than
with the other articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked through the window again, and Harris
was at the stake, and, with impatient yells, the savages
were making ready for the sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spare him—only spare the life of Harris, and take
all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We <span class='it'>have</span> all, and now we will consummate the
work. Hark ye, Dahona! Harris must suffer the torments
to which our captives are condemned. We
have been injured by the whites. Your father was our
chief—they destroyed him; and whose blood has
flowed in revenge? You, the daughter of that chief,
have been made to despise the people of your tribe,
and to adopt the faith of the whites—a creed that
makes one portion cowards—afraid of the life or the
death of a warrior—and leaves the other portion to
commit what crimes they choose upon the red
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, hear me, Dahona. It is the creed that makes
the man, and not the man the creed; and the influence
of your profession of that creed—the devotion which
you pay to that book now lying at your feet—are
weakening the attachment of our people to their chiefs,
and giving power to the whites. Renounce the creed,
spurn the book at your feet, and follow your brethren
to their hunting grounds, and we will spare Harris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will follow you whither you wish—take me now;
but first release that man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you renounce the white man’s creed—will you
spurn the Bible in presence of our men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hours before, the troubled spirit of Rebecca
had been moved almost to doubt the truth of the religion
into which she had been initiated; but when
the question was its renunciation, she felt the hold
which it had upon her mind—she showed the hold
which it had upon her heart. Could she, with some
mental reservation, make the renunciation, and thus
save her benefactor’s life? She was not well versed
in casuistry, but she knew that religion was of the
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak,” said the chief; “the people are waiting
my signal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a moment to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it. I will leave you until the messenger returns
twice with new combustibles for the old man’s
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief closed the door, and Rebecca turned to
seek guidance in her troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savage crew had seized upon the person of Mr.
Harris, and dragged him from the house to the place
appointed for his torments. A slow fire was to be
lighted around him, and his dying moments were to be
embittered by their blasphemies, and his pains augmented
by the torments which they would inflict before
the flame should have done its work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good man looked around. William he had
heard in the first of the attack, and he now believed
him dead. He knew that he had little to fear for Rebecca;
her captivity might be irksome, but beyond that
they would not injure her. But Pompey, with all his
professions, where was he at such a time? How useful
he might have been—how consoling, even now, to
have seen him near, and to have sent by him messages
to his friends. But he was forsaken of all—of all but
his enemies; and so he looked upward, to <span class='sc'>One</span> that had
ever been his friend. Release was not to be expected.
Mercy, fortitude, resignation—and the good man
breathed a fervent prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The time is up,” said the stern chief, as he opened
the door of Rebecca’s chamber. “What say you—life
or death to Harris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see my father, even as he is—let me commune
with him for one moment, and I will answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief led forth the girl; and as he passed two of
his men he said, in his own language:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch the house; and when the fire is lighted at
the stake, set the house on fire—both the white and
black are in it some where. See that none escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca heard and understood the terrible order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman ascended the pile, and threw her
arms around the neck of Harris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father! my father! must this be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no preventive,” said he, “short of a miracle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca sobbed into the ear of her benefactor, the
condition of his release.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will never release me,” said he; “they may
make you an apostate, but they will also make me a
martyr.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, they have sworn the oath that has never
yet been violated, when given from Indian to Indian,
that they <span class='it'>will</span> release you on those conditions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has that oath never failed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never—never, my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me not fall into the hands of man,” said the
prisoner; “in this hour, God, be my guide and
counsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the answer, my father? Remember,
your life—your precious life, may be saved, and that of
William,” she whispered softly in his ears. “Do not
hesitate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not hesitate for myself. How, my child, is
thy faith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
“Firm—fixed, my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you renounce it, if by that you could save
the life of William and become his wife with my consent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not renounce that faith to add one moment
to <span class='it'>my</span> life. Now, more than ever, do I see and feel its
excellency. But you, my father, in whom it shines,
may, by a protracted life, disseminate that faith to
thousands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I insure the faith of others by my own
apostacy? You have my answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca gave one wild, frantic shriek, and was
forced, almost lifeless, from the embraces of Harris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what says Dahona now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I will not renounce my faith.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The signal was given, and the men arranged themselves
between the river and the stake, and two or
three sprung forward and applied their torches to the
dry wood; slowly the smoke ascended, and then the
blaze crept upward, while the loud shouts of the exulting
savages drowned the prayer and groans of Harris
and the wild shrieks of Rebecca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apply the tortures,” said the chief, and he sprung
forward to give the example; when, suddenly, he
pitched forward upon the fire, and the crack of numerous
rifles told whence his death had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one minute the ground was filled with Indians of
another tribe, and the survivors of the invading band
ware escaping down the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the mingled throng of living, and over the
bodies of the dead, sprung one being upon the burning
pile, and with a hatchet released the sufferer from his
perilous position, as the fire was doing the work which
the savages had left unaccomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the rescuer laid Mr. Harris on the ground, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hi!</span> Massa Harris, didn’t I tell you, great while
ago, ‘bym by come sometime or odder?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pompey had escaped before the Indians surrounded
the house, and knowing the attachment to Mr. Harris
of a tribe a short distance above, and their hostility to
those who had invaded the settlement, he was sure of
aid if he could summons them in season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friendly Indians descended the river rapidly in
their canoes, and were only in season to save the life
of the whites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William was brought <a id='for'></a>forth wounded, but not dangerously,
and the family assembled in prayer and
thanksgiving, while their friendly deliverers were discharging
some of the minor offices of their calling and
celebrating their victory by some characteristic <a id='atten'></a>attentions
to the wounded whom the enemy had left on
the shores of the Susquehanna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not hesitate, my child,” said Mr. Harris
to Rebecca, “when death or apostacy was proposed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When <span class='it'>your</span> death was the alternative, I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where, then, was your faith in Christianity—in its
author?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I am weak. I owe you obligations—I
would sacrifice my life for your comforts; I knew you
good—I knew you would decide correctly. My faith,
then, was in <span class='it'>you</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In <span class='it'>you</span>—in you, oh, my more than father. You
are the embodiment of that <span class='it'>spirit</span> by which I am
guided. My faith in you, then—is it not my faith in
the creed which you profess, and by which you live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had William recovered from his wounds,
than Mr. Harris called Rebecca to him and signified
his consent to the union between her and William, and
his determination to make their circumstances as comfortable
as the state of the neighborhood would allow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is late, now,” said Rebecca to William; “let us
separate. The morrow will require our early attention,
and Father Harris will be astir early in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he not the only one,” said William; “for
some of us must go down and bring the magistrate up,
to perform the ceremony. We will meet early to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the dawn of the day fixed on for her marriage,
Rebecca left her chamber, and hastened along
the banks of the river to the jutting promontory that
she so much loved. Leaning there upon the side of a
rock, she gave vent to all those feelings which spring
up in the heart of a girl who stands upon the verge of
marriage. Welling up from that heart were the waters
of pure, holy affection for Harris, and of deep, abiding
love for William. There was no want of all true
feelings—no doubt of the high deservings of her lover.
But Rebecca’s education was imperfect; it had never
eradicated the strong feelings for her own people; it
had led her to see how rapid must be their decay, but
it had not made her cling with undivided love to those
whose superiority in certain points was exhibiting
itself in the destruction of the natives; for she saw that
the friendship of the whites was as fatal to the Indians
as was their enmity. The lands passed as fast by cession
as by conquest, and vices were sent with the wampum
of peace as readily as with the weapon of war.
And while she felt that she could apply no remedy, or
<span class='it'>become</span> a preventive, she yet felt for those whose
blood was in her veins—whose fathers’ fame had been
her glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, children of the forest,” said she, as she bent
her eyes upon mountains and table lands above, “ye
are passing away like the leaves of autumn. The
frosts and the sunshine are alike fatal to you, and ere
long you will be known only by your decay. Men
will <span class='it'>tell</span> of your glories—but who shall <span class='it'>see</span> them?
Dim shadows yet linger on the forest edge, and I catch
the view of half fading forms as I look along the valley
of the stream. Are these the spirits of my fathers
come to chide me, their daughter, for my apostacy?
Alas! what an apostacy is that of their sons, who retain
the customs of the tribes, and yet adopt the vices
of the whites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The light of another day is springing up, and a
thousand shapes are visible; are these spirit-hunters of
the red men—do they sanctify the night by their chase?
They are not like the red men of those days. Mighty
ones they are, and they pursue the mammoth for their
sport. But how they depart before the coming light,
as their descendants waste in the influence of the arts
of the white men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ought I to wish it otherwise? Will not science
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
make more happy, and religion repay by its influences
all the evil which has been brought on its name? Has
it done it? Alas! I am distressed. What is to be the
effect of all? Are the white men, with their religion,
to drive the red men from their possession only to have
more ample scope for vice, only to waste each other by
the fraud with which they, in most places, overcome
the Indians? or is the establishment of both to produce
the happiness to all which is promised by their leaders?
And are these doubts, these apparent difficulties, the
result of my inability to judge of what is to follow, as
the vision is now disturbed by the uncertainty of the
dawning light, whose perfection will restore all things
to their proper appearance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let me yet, as I shall abide with these conquerors
of our people, let me at least acknowledge that
it is not they but their religion that detains me. No,
deeply as I reverence my Father Harris, and much as I
love William, I would join the wasting, the decaying
remnant of my tribe; and if I could not revenge their
wrongs, I would die with them undisgraced by
treachery. But that religion—ah, they hold me there;
they have driven from my heart most of the creed of my
childhood. Only here and there is found a belief, green,
from its association with infancy, but still beautiful,
still cherished. While they have erected in my heart
the form of their own faith, unfinished yet, but still
promising, still sheltering. They have dealt with me
as with our forests, in which our tribes had their home,
they cut them down, leaving here and there a tree to
tell of the things that were, and placing incomplete
edifices for their own shelter—edifices that they promise
shall be sufficient and beautiful in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was rising above the horizon, and not a cloud
stood in his whole pathway to the west. The tops of
the mountain caught and reflected its first rays. As
the warmth increased, the mists, which had fallen
thick toward the base of the hills, began slowly to rise
and roll in massive columns upward, or to pass off by
the <span class='it'>gap</span> through which the river rushes. Rebecca
gazed at the scene until her fancy moulded these morning
mists into the forms of cherished beings. The
whole energies of her tribe seemed to revive within
her, and all of the wild and the unearthly that distinguished
the dreams of her childhood rushed back upon
her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you all,” said she, “chiefs, warriors and
women. I know ye now; every one has his form,
and ye are returning from the hunting-field of spirits.
Ye return mournful, though borne down with game;
sad, for ye cross the fields which the whites have torn
from your descendants; angry, for a child of a warrior
is to be of those who are your enemies—and yonder
group of little ones, they are my brothers and sisters,
airy ones now, but happy in the mimic hunt, happy
till they turn their faces on me, the last of all the household.
And, father—oh, my father, the death-wound
is yet upon thy breast, as thou movest onward in the
air. Mother! mother! look not thus on thy child!
Oh, turn not to me that breast whence I drew my life-nurture;
that breast on which I rested when the life-drops
were oozing forth from the wound which the
enemy inflicted. But they are happy—happy in their
union, happy in the smiles of the Great Spirit whom
they adored in their homes and their hunting-grounds,
whom they propitiated by terrible vengeance upon
those who desecrated those homes and destroyed
those hunting-grounds. They are happy, for the mist
that gathers round my mother’s brow is resplendent
with rainbow beams, and as she passes upward to the
mountain’s summit, she waves her hand to me in
peace. Thy pardon and thy blessing, oh, my mother—prostrate,
I invoke them both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>William, who had witnessed the last agonizing scene,
then stepped forward and raised the girl from the deep
earth. She scarcely noticed his presence, the wildness
of her eye denoted thoughts differently placed; and
it was several minutes before she recovered her usual
self-possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is passed, William, and we will now return to
the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Rebecca, why should you thus have exposed
yourself and your health by such a yielding to the influence
of your feelings and your imagination?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William, I am, or I would be, a Christian; and
when I have given myself to <span class='it'>you</span> and to God, I would
have no reserve in my heart from either, and therefore,
before the sacrifice was made, as the daughter
of the Judge of Israel went forth upon the high-places of
her land to mourn, so I came hither to weep for what
I was to leave, and to leave that for which I wept.
The last sacrifice upon the altar of my fathers and
my fathers’ deities has been made. I have torn from
my heart the flowers which grew upon the Indian’s
belief, and have prayed that the tree of life may over-shadow
the wild plants, that they blossom not again.
I have taken down from the recesses of my soul, the
gods which my mother enshrined there, and have taken
leave of the living and the dead of my father’s race.
And now, William, now my beloved one, I am thine—thine
in all seasons and all changes—thine, loving
and loved; but, oh, do not forget that my mind, though
dedicated to Christianity now, has been the <span class='it'>home</span> of
the red man’s creed, and may yet while it is sanctified
by the new altar, reflect something of itself, its other
self upon the purer worship, as the temples dedicated
to the pagan god seem to cast some air of their origin
upon the new and sanctified rites which they now
enclose; and in moments of feeling, or when some
additional wrong to my fathers’ race is done in the
name of our new creed, bear with me, if for a moment,
I forget the blessed teaching of the gospel, and yield to
the earlier influences of blood, of education and patriotism.
It shall not be often, not for the world.
Henceforth, my beloved one, I am thine; all of childhood’s
home—all of a people’s wrongs—all of a
nation’s faith and a nation’s gods, are given up—and
all of thine adopted. Thy breast shall be my pillow
in trouble, and thy smile my token of joy; thy welfare
shall be my happiness, thy dwelling shall be my home,
‘thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>William pressed to his heart the confiding, beautiful
girl; and they turned to leave the eminence upon which
they stood, and to join the family below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exceeding beauty of the morning induced them
to look once more and admire the scene. The whole
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
broad river below them seemed one floating mass of
light; and as the current passed on, its surface was
disturbed by the boughs of the overhanging trees that
dipped into the water, and created ripples that reflected
all the hues of the moving light. The mountains in
the west seemed clothed in gorgeous sunbeams, and
nature appeared to have assumed her richest garb, to
bless the nuptials that were about to take place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love this scene,” said Rebecca, “it tranquilizes
me—it soothes my spirit, it elevates without agitating
my mind—such a morning is a teacher of religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Spirit of God is teaching every where,” said
William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true,” said Rebecca, “but I seem to lack
some visible object, something upon which my eye
may rest, something like the ladder of Jacob, by which
I may ascend; the visible is necessary to me, to fix
my thought upon and draw it up to the invisible. Is
not your creed deficient in that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can there be a better man than Father Harris,
and have you ever heard of one less influenced by the
visible and tangible, and more guided by faith in the
unseen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True—but it is his goodness, his attainment in that
grace which enable him to dispense with the visible.
You white men cut and blaze the trees of the forest
so that you may recognize the course by which you
are to reach a desired point, but the Indian passes onward
through the densest wood, with no visible sign,
no outward evidence of the path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Rebecca, the white men find that their cuttings
and blazings are imitated, so that it is difficult to
tell in time which is the right mark, and resort must
be had yet to the invisible to correct the visible. The
former deceives us often—the latter never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand in hand the pair returned to the mansion of
Mr. Harris, and the day thus <a id='begun'></a>begun in sacrifice and
prayer, was closed in festivity. And William received
to his arms his Indian bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little enclosure at Harrisburg is a frail but eloquent
memorial of the virtue and sufferings of Mr.
Harris, and the fidelity of Pompey. The former
handed down his name and his virtues to a numerous
posterity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pompey, undoubtedly, is represented by some of his
own color even in the present day. The great reward
which he claimed for his successful exertions to save
his master’s life, was permission to introduce a fiddle
into the settlement; and for years afterward the banks
of the Susquehanna were made melodious by the
joyful notes which Pompey drew from his favorite instrument,
while blithely and strong was heard the
footfall of the young at night, as they danced to the
music of the Orpheus of their time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William’s descendents are in and around Harrisburg,
holding office when they can get it, and dividing themselves
between the two, or occasionally among the
many parties, so that the advantage of ascendency by
either fraction may not be entirely lost by all. These
are not the children of Rebecca; she died young—her
frame of mind was not favorable to long life. She
died a Christian, firm, consistent, active, growing
always in faith, and full of good works; and yet it was
remarked by the excellent clergyman whose teaching
she followed, that her mind seemed never to have dismissed
entirely the creed of her childhood—and all
her pure faith, all her Christian zeal, all her holy life,
appeared to have some tinge of the creed of her fathers—not
to alter the body of her faith, but merely to give
it, at times, a color. “And,” said a successor of that
clergyman, “have not the teachings she adopted,
teachings of Christianity, always been thus affected
by the previous character of the community or individuals
by which they have been received?” No
requirement diminished, no duty changed, no obligation
dispensed, but a sort of reservation of a non-essential,
which served to reflect a separate ray upon
the admitted and the requisite. Religious truth, though
enforced by divine grace, must in general be conveyed
by a human medium, which will impart a portion of
itself or its accidents, as the color of the atmosphere
through which light is conveyed to earth gives hue and
tinge to the rays, without diminishing essentially their
powers to guide by their light, or invigorate by their
heat. Nay, when we concentrate these rays to
convey them to particular objects, the light not only
takes the tinge of the medium, but it has also the divergency
and eccentricity consequent upon the inequalities
of surface, or the impurities of the glass
through which it comes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca lived to bless her husband by her domestic
virtues and her unfailing affection. Her death was
mourned wherever her beautiful example of womanly
virtue and Christian integrity was known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[After the above narrative was prepared for the press,
numerous letters that passed between Rebecca and her
school-mates—one or two to Mr. Harris—and some to her
lover, and two to her husband, near the close of her life,
were supplied to the writer by the same person who
furnished the materials for the story. They could not well
be introduced with the narrative, but may be given hereafter,
should it appear that they have interest enough for
the pages of this Magazine.]</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOUR I.—<span class='it'>A Betrothal.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The princes of the night came, one by one, into the
halls of Heaven, and each, from his refulgent throne,
sped far and wide through space his beams of glory.
The earth saw the regal train, and rejoiced, saying,
“I am their sister;” then the shadows passed away
from her bosom, and she stood in radiance amid her
starry compeers, sending back ray for ray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lillian, let us look upon the night,” cried
Kenneth—and he led her forth beneath the stars.
They smiled upon the maid, and crowned her forehead
with their beams, and her beauty grew as lofty and
mysterious as their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair walked in silence, for each bosom throbbed
heavily, with its burden of unspoken love; they walked
in silence, for youth was in flushing, and they heeded
not the speeding hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First Kenneth spoke, for man must <span class='it'>act</span> while woman
muses, and the spells of night oppressed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Lillian, on the shining orbs above us, circling
their mysterious round! Knowest thou, the starry
firmament is a vast prophecy of things to be? Yon
burning record of the decrees of fate rolls its stupendous
riddles in mighty round, and mock our earnest
inquiry. The learning of the Magi, the ‘Persians
starry wit,’ may catch but faint and far-off glimpses
of the truths they blazon yet conceal. The boasted
lore of the Chaldean, reads but imperfectly their dim
revealings, while the Gheber, wiser in his ignorance
than either, bows in worship to the celestial mysteries
he presumeth not to compass or comprehend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a majesty and gloom in the boy’s conceptions
that charmed and oppressed fair Lillian; and,
as woman is prone to do, she turned from all the rolling
worlds of which he spoke, to the deep, silent, and no
less enigmatical world of her own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked again upon the heavens on which was
written, as he believed, the fate of nations, while her
meek eyes followed his, striving to read from the
jeweled scroll, her own doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenneth,” she cried, abruptly, and in awe, “I feel
that I am approaching a crisis in my fate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy fate, sweet one, is also written in letters of
light above us. I am not deeply versed in heavenly
lore, but from thy presentiment and mine, I read a
crisis is at hand. Seest thou yon pale orb,” he continued,
raising his hand aloft, “my father told me once
it shone upon <span class='it'>thy</span> birth, and from that hour it has been
the object of my vigil and study; so pale, so pure, it
seemeth like thy fair face set in heaven. Of late methought
it shone with sadder beam, and wandered from
its track. See!” he cried with a shout, “it journeys
the skies, side by side, with yon red-eyed planet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lillian raised her soft eyes, and met the lurid glare
of the blood-red star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What orb is that?” she inquired, with a shudder,
clinging closer to Kenneth’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The star of my nativity!</span>”</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Lillian! <span class='it'>my</span> Lillian! tremble not, beloved! hath
not kind Heaven given thee to me?” He wound his
arms around her frail form, and laid her to his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dark youth, I fear thee!” she shrieked, and bursting
from his embrace, fled into the night. Suddenly
she paused, and covering her face with her hands,
crushed the big tears that were gushing from their
fountains, “ay!” she murmured, “but I love thee also!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou dost, my fawn!” said Kenneth, as he regained
her side, “swear, then, to be mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden hesitated, for the angel whose ward
she was, whispered a warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swear not, for his brow is dark and his heart
fierce—his path lieth through blood, and endeth in
blackness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then love lifted up his voice, crying, “What grief
so great as parting from thy beloved! What wo so
heavy as a disappointed heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the maiden said, “I swear! Whether for good
or evil, for blessing or for blight, my doom is sealed,
and I am thine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The crisis is past, beloved,” whispered the wooer—“where
is now thy fear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden abode in the halls of her sires, while
the youth rode forth intent on valiant deeds, for ’twas
in the days when a hero’s laurels were his bridal gift.
But his heart was not strong in hope—neither was it
girt with patience—neither was it seasoned with
denial; and temptation beset him by the way and endurance
failed, and when he returned, his knightly
spurs were dimmed, and tarnished his knightly honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, spurn me not, beloved!” he cried, in agonized
abasement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the lady answered, “Through glory and shame
I will be true to thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then was Kenneth comforted by her tenderness,
and strengthened by her counsels—and he went forth
with hope to retrieve the errors of the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the glory of his youth had departed, and the
fear of God dwelt no more in his bosom; and his heart
was curdled by the scorn of men, and hardened against
his kind; and his right hand became a hand of power,
but it was red with wrath—and injustice, and oppression,
and cruelty, and wrong, and rapine, and murder,
stalked in his train. Then he returned to his lady,
and stood before her with a sullen brow, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my valor have I won my bride!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Kenneth!” she faltered, “thou hast despised
my counsels, thou hast mocked at my love; thy path
hath been a path of blood, and thy crimes rise mountain-high
between thee and thy affianced! Oh, why
hast thou done this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scales fell from his eyes in that pure presence,
and looking back over the guilt of years, he felt appalled
by his own sins.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
“The stars, in their courses, fought against me,”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>
he answered gloomily—“it was my destiny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, abandon that fearful error, and cease to burden
Fate with thy misdeeds. Thy destiny hath been of
thine own choosing. Didst thou not turn a deaf ear
to the pleadings of all good angels? Didst thou not
yield an easy prey to the devices of thine own heart?
For the sake of the future, look back upon the past,
and tell me if thou canst not recall the hour when two
paths were spread before thee, and thou didst choose
thy lot; tell me no more of destiny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lady hath forgotten her meekness as well as
her love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenneth, reproach me not! I have wasted my
youth in vigils for thee; I have watched, and wept,
and waited, now in hope, and anon in hopelessness,
until sorrow shadowed my father’s halls, and mildew
settled down on my heart. Now in the depths of my
despair I love thee still, but I <span class='it'>dare not</span> wed thee! Go
in peace; if man may ever meddle with his fate, mine
shall be of my own moulding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fashion it as thou wilt,” he answered fiercely,
“<span class='it'>I will come to claim thee in the appointed hour!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fair Lillian sitteth in her husband’s home, but a

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOUR II.—<span class='it'>The Consummation.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The princes of the night mounted their flaming
steeds and coursed through heaven. Lillian sat in
widow’s weeds, and watched them from her great
round tower. Suddenly the clang of a mailed heel
rung on the winding stair, and her cheek paled—for
those halls no longer echoed with martial sounds since
Lord Ulric had been gathered home. Near and
more near, loud and more loud, and a warrior strode
into the apartment, and folded the lady in his embrace!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I have come!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those old, familiar, long beloved tones, how they
broke upon the loneliness, thrilling to its centre her
sorrow-stricken heart. What marvel if she wept unresistingly
on his broad breast, in her agony of
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to claim my bride!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then was the spell broken, and her soul awoke to a
sense of its stern resolves. She freed herself from
that passionate embrace, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may not wed thee, Kenneth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But listen to my pleadings, my long lost one; canst
thou not divinely forgive the past, and be my guardian
angel for the future? Hast thou ceased to love, or
hast thou learned to fear me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenneth, thou art accursed of God, and abhorred
of men, and yet I fear thee not. Thou wert the lover
of my youth, ever fond, ever tender; and thy name,
so dreaded in the land thou hast scourged, is to me but
a talisman of gentle memories. I fear thee not. But
I have walked through life with a strong hand on my
heart, curbing its warm impulses, crushing its fond
love. It hath plead passionately for thee, but I hearkened
not, and by this bitter schooling have I learned
to resist even <span class='it'>thee</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, have I not, ’mid sin and sorrow, ’mid
wreck of hopes and ruin of soul, preserved undimmed
my one bright dream of thee? Have I not sat by a
lonely hearth, while thy smile filled the home of my
rival with joy? Have I not forborne to tear thee
thence, because I would not offer violence to thee or
thine? And now wilt thou reject the love which youth
hath sanctified, and manhood ripened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, why hast thou not wedded and forgotten me?”
she cried, in anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the hope of thy pale waning beauty was
dearer to my heart than all the daughters of bloom.
Because I would be ever ready for the hour when fate
should say, ‘arise, make ready thy bower for thy
promised bride;’ <span class='it'>that hour has come</span>! Mark the
heavens where ’tis written, thou art mine. Once, long
ago, we looked upon the night with all its circling
stars; thou seest them now, as then, treading their
solemn round, unchanged, unchangeable. Not one of
all the starry hosts may wander from its appointed
pathway; and canst thou, child of destiny, escape thy
fate? The hand that guides <span class='it'>them</span>, governs <span class='it'>thee</span>, and
the decrees of the Omnipotent have been, from all
eternity, and are immutable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, tell me no more of thy stern, unpitying faith!
thou hast imbued my mind with thy belief, until, like
the scorpion girt with fire, I have almost turned on
myself despairing. I would fain believe that the
struggles and strivings of humanity are not without
their fruits; that the fervent prayer, the earnest effort,
are heard, and heeded; that man may wrestle all
night with his Maker, and when the morning breaks,
prevail.”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Very touching was the fierce man’s tenderness, but
the lady was strong in her heart’s martyrdom. Then
he turned away, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou hast destroyed the hope of a lifetime, and
my father’s lore hath failed me. How could I thus
misread the stars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the battlement he looked on heaven thus
questioning, and the stars grew dim beneath his
gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orb that beamed upon his lady’s birth, sent
down its calm, cold ray; his own more fiery planet
blazed in lurid light, while an ocean of space rolled
between.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost to me!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, the red planet shot madly from its
sphere, careering athwart the concave like a sword of
fire, it rushed from being, and deeper darkness brooded
o’er the expanse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again his eye sought the milder light of the star
he worshiped, when lo! <span class='it'>it had been swept from the
face of heaven</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so, lost Pleiad!” cried the lover, and folding
in his arms the pallid lady, leaped from the turret, into
the abyss below.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY STELLA MARTIN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter of 1692 was no mild specimen of the
climate of the New England wilds. The settlers on
the inhospitable coast of Maine found its severity to
exceed all their apprehensions. The few comforts
which they had as yet been able to gather around
them, were inadequate to the wants of that long and
dreary season. Many fell victims of hardships and
despondency; while not a few toiled on, cheerful and
uncomplaining examples of endurance and suffering.
It was perhaps more fortunate for the northern settlements
than their pioneers, that they were commenced
in summer, for the cold and inclemency of their early
winters were enough to sadden the heart, and blast
the hopes of the most visionary dreamer. The stranger
who built his rude open hut in pleasant June, fanned
by cool breezes during his summer toil, wot not that a
few months would bring a bleakness of which he had
little conception. The settlements on the Piscataqua
are among the oldest in Maine; and to those who first
selected the romantic site of the now beautiful village
of York, it seemed enchanted land. Primeval forests
covered the whole country through which the Piscataqua
and its Naiad Sisters wound their way to the
sea. The delicate foliage of the beech and poplar, the
deep sombre green of the hemlock and fir, the pale,
graceful willow, and the bright emerald maple, all
blended to form a perfect forest robe, as yet untouched
by the devastating hand of man. Bald peaks lent
wildness to the scene, already diversified by the commanding
banks of the rivers which lay calmly mirrored
in their deep, clear waters. No wonder the early
adventurers looked with rapturous delight upon the
broad bays studded with islands, the green promontories
and quiet harbors into which the streams widening
their channels, gradually lost themselves in the
Atlantic. The sea-fowl bathed its drooping plumage
unmolested on the shores, the wild-cat ran at will,
guided only by the impulses of its savage nature, and
the graceful deer proudly reared its antlered head, and
bounded away, the undisturbed inhabitant of the
mighty wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him who, tired with the bondage of the old
world, sought refuge in the new, these were glowing
emblems of that liberty he so earnestly longed for. He
hailed the land spread out before him, in all the magnificence
of nature, as that which would realize his
most chimerical ideas of happiness. Imagination
added to its charms, and converted what was truly
wild and beautiful into a paradise. The toils and dangers
of the frontier life vanished away; and with a
buoyant heart the wanderer adopted the unknown
soil, alike ignorant and unmindful of the ills that would
cluster around his future path. When want shall have
been encountered in every form, sickness endured,
famine driven from the door, and “hope, the star that
leads the weary on,” delusive hope, shall whisper of
bliss to come, he is destined to find in the savage
tribes of the country, enemies more formidable than
the evils of his condition. Hard fate! to survive the
strife of the elements, to escape pestilence and danger
only to perish by a relentless <span class='it'>human</span> foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The settlement of York had enjoyed several years
of prosperity, the effects of which were perceptible in
a considerable degree of neatness and comfort about
its dwellings. This appearance of thrift made it a
surer mark for destruction. In January, 1692, a band
of Abenakis and French burst upon this defenseless
village, “offering its inhabitants captivity or death.”
A terrible storm had just covered the earth with snow,
to a depth which would have proved a barrier to any
but these intrepid barbarians. They had walked on
snow-shoes, the long distance from the basin of the
St. John’s, the difficulties of the way only serving to
increase their insatiable thirst for bloodshed. It was
a serene winter’s evening, when the Abenaki braves
surrounded their council-fire, a few miles from the
doomed village, to determine upon their mode of
assault. The purity of nature in these snowy solitudes
strangely contrasted with the sanguinary deeds plotted
there. She witnesses in silence the offences of her
children. She beholds the members of the great brotherhood
of man rise up and destroy each other, yet
thunders no warning to the victim, nor hurls the fire
of heaven upon the destroyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stealthily advanced the murderers, while the peaceful
inhabitants of York were gathered around their
happy firesides. Ah, never more will those family
groups meet around the altar of prayer, never again
together join the festive dance. That ringing war-whoop
which strikes the ear is the death-knell of the
unsuspecting villagers. Mother, take a last look at
thy darling, ere its baby face is snatched forever from
you. Husband, clasp thy wife to thy bosom, for that
fond embrace shall be the last. Lover, thou art vainly
striving to wrest thy cherished one from the barbarian’s
grasp—thy agonizing efforts to save her, make
her a prize in those savage eyes; and, unfortunate girl,
instead of mingling thy blood with thy kindred, a captivity
awaits thee a thousand times more horrible
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lot befell Amy Wakefield. She saw her mother
fall lifeless from the first blow of the tomahawk.
Her father, with the fury of a madman, sprung upon
the assassin, and proved the avenger of his wife.
Swift as thought, however, he was overborne by the
comrades of the dead Indian, and he lay a mangled
corse beside his beloved companion; one son and a
servant girl shared the same fate. Poor, gentle, timid
Amy! there she stood petrified by the awful sight before
her, but she made no effort to escape. Vain indeed
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
would have been the attempt; her nonresistance
saved her life, and prolonged her sufferings. No scalping-knife
was uplifted over her head, but as if her
sentence was written on her brow, they proceeded
without a moment’s hesitation to bind her hands behind
her. Richard Russel rushed into the street at
the first alarm, and ye who know a lover’s heart
can tell why he flew with the speed of lightning, to
seek Amy Wakefield—his betrothed bride. He entered
the dwelling where he knew carnage and death
were doing their dreadful work; but what was danger
to him, with such an object at stake!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Richard,” said Amy, opening her lips for the
first time since her mother’s dying shriek had sealed
them, in a tone which would have melted a heart less
sensitive than his. He darted forward, seized the
Indian who was binding her, and with a maniac’s
gripe wrestled for the mastery. Young Russel,
tall and athletic, was considered the most vigorous
young man in the colony, but his strength was unequal
to that of the sinewy son of the forest. A blow from
a war-club felled him senseless to the earth. “Merciful
God!” cried poor Amy in the anguish of her soul,
as her last earthly hope was quenched within her.
She was dragged from the spot where lay all she held
dear. As she passed the door, a kindly stupor seized
her; neither the screams of the villagers, nor the
kindling flames of the cottages, roused her. She looked
vacantly around, but heeded not what she saw. She
felt no grief—she had no consciousness. The scenes
of the past half hour had banished her senses, and bewildered
her mind. They seemed like a terrific
vision in a dream—hideously vivid, without the power
of realizing or escaping from it. Why did not oblivion
forever steal over the past, or delirium cheat the
soul in future?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work of death was done. The slain were
sepulchred in the ashes of their cottage homes; the
captives were divided as spoils among the warriors,
and toward morning they started for the northeast.
Amy Wakefield and three other prisoners were the
especial care of two Abenakis and a Frenchman, Jean
Mordaunt. The whole party moved rapidly, lest the
neighboring settlements should see the light of the
burning village, and pursue them; but this little company
were the foremost. The other captives with
Amy were men, but she kept pace with them and the
Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hurried along as if she were fleeing from enemies.
All that day she traveled on, taking no food, uttering
no complaint; and at last, when night came, she sunk
down unconcernedly to sleep. It was one of their
former stopping places, and the Indians rekindled the
fires, which had scarcely expired. The poor captives
gathered around them and welcomed the burning heat,
though hardly more comfortable than the chilling blasts
to which they had been exposed. Oh, the sorrows of
that weary journey—cold, hunger and thirst were
among the least of them. The Indians returned by
the trail in which they came; but the snow was untrodden
and deep, and the path lay through forests and
across rivers. Some drooped by the way and received
beatings for their manifestations of fatigue,
whilst many found snowy graves. For many days
they traveled on together, but finally separated in little
bands for the settlements where they belonged, each
carrying with them their captives. This last sad comfort
of friends and neighbors traveling together in their
misery, was now denied them, and they looked each
other a last adieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said Amy slept. It was a blessed sleep, for it
carried her back to childhood’s days; now she was
gathering violets with her little brothers on the river’s
bank; now she saw her brother’s angel face, and
heard her father’s “dear little Amy.” Then time flew
by, and she felt her lover’s warm kisses; years seemed
moments, and moments years—and still she slept on.
Would that she might have slept “that sleep from which
none ever wake to weep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was high in the heavens ere they roused
them from their slumbers. The labors of the previous
day were exhausting even to the Indian’s strong frame.
Some of the wretched captives had passed a sleepless
night from fear or excessive weariness; and to some
their aching limbs forbade rest. But Amy still lay
with her head thrown back, her hands clasped; her
marble face and motionless lips rendered still more
striking by the profusion of black hair lying disheveled
about her. The Indian who advanced to awaken her,
paused, as if he shrunk from such a personification of
purity. He took hold of her shoulder and shook her;
but it seemed as if her senses were bound by death’s
icy chains. He struck her a rough blow on the side
of her head. She opened her eyes, and tried to rise,
but her limbs refused her support, and she fell back.
She looked up—her consciousness returned. The sight
of the Indian’s face brought back the scenes of that
dreadful night, and she trembled like an aspen leaf.
But another blow for her tardiness, brought a full conception
of her situation, and a flood of tears. Her stiff,
feeble movements, the tears running in torrents down
her cheeks, were a strange counterpart to the day before.
They started; she tried to proceed, but her
limbs seemed paralyzed, and her heart died within her.
She forgot all around, even her own wretchedness;
she remembered only that cottage scene, Richard, and
her parents—and she prayed for death. Her sobs
were heart-rending, still the cruel savages urged her
on. Oh, were there no friendly angels abroad in the
earth; was mercy fled, and vengeance dead! At
length the Indians, enraged at what they considered
the girl’s obstinacy, raised a club to strike her, but
Mordaunt, who, perhaps, had enough of humanity to
be touched by the spectacle before him, leaped forward,
averted the blow, and talking with them a few
moments in their own rude, wild tongue, seemed to
calm their anger. Soon after this there was a division
of the company; Amy and some others, who were incapable
of keeping up with the main party, were put
together and allowed to proceed more slowly; still
she went weeping on—that painful way was traced in
tears, and the desert solitudes echoed with her sighs.
After about three weeks, the Indians discerned their
“smokes” in the distance, and saluted them with
shoutings and expressions of great joy. Amy’s peculiar
grief had awakened some little pity, even in
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
the bosoms of her savage captors. To this, and the
influence of Mordaunt, whose notice she had attracted
ever since the first morning, when she lay an unconscious
sleeper beside their fires, she owed her comparatively
easy lot. She was given to Wiloma, the
wife of Great Turtle, the last king, who kept her to do
her menial drudgery, but treated her with some
kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean Mordaunt was a Jesuit missionary. He belonged
to a class of whom mankind has drawn widely
varying pictures. Pious, devoted, self-sacrificing, ambitious,
crafty and revengeful, are, doubtless, all true
descriptions of this fraternity, who have left no country
without its representatives, and whose name is Legion.
America, the “land of mountains and eagles,” early
drew them hither, and here we see their character in
all its phases. They penetrated nearly every recess
on the northern part of our continent, and visited
almost all of the Indian tribes, teaching them the name
of Jesus and the Virgin Mother; some affirming in their
enthusiasm, that “the path to heaven was as open
through a roof of bark, as through arched ceilings of
silver and gold.” “Not a cape was turned, nor a river
entered, but a Jesuit led the way,” says the eloquent
historian, Bancroft. “The cross and the lily, emblems
of France and Christianity,” were carved on
the trees, and inscribed on the rocks. Many, like
Mesnard, or the gentle Marquette, found quiet resting-places
in the wilderness; and the western waters
which wash their graves, perpetually sing their dirge.
But Gabriel Lallemand, Father Jaques, Jean De Brebeuf,
René Goupil, and many others, sealed their labors
with their blood. Their memory is precious
to the mother church; and what wonder that her
sons and daughters revere them as saints. But there
were a vast multitude who claimed the same mission
of love and mercy with these martyrs of holy zeal,
whose lives and characters too plainly betrayed their
hypocrisy. There were those whose religion cloaked
their ambition, and others in whom intrigue had supplanted
all the simplicity of the gospel. Instead of
religious teachers, they often became artful politicians.
That the French Jesuits participated in, and often instigated
the attacks upon the English border settlements,
is so well attested, that it cannot be denied.
The enmity between the French and English nations
was too deeply seated to be forgotten by their colonists,
and often led them to rouse the merciless savage against
their unguarded neighbors. It is difficult to conceive
how a minister of that blessed religion which proclaims
“peace and good-will to men,” should have so far
forgot its precepts, as to be present at the bloody massacre
of York; but Jean Mordaunt was there. Perhaps
he did not stain his hands with blood, but he
spotted his soul with guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy Wakefield gradually recovered her spent
energies. Her elastic constitution rebounded from
the severe shocks it had received, but her sufferings
left an indelible impress on her spirits. Time could
not restore the loved ones sleeping in the dust, and
smiles bade adieu to her once happy face. Like
Egeria of yore, she forever mourned her heart’s lost
treasures. Mordaunt dwelt upon that beautiful sorrowing
face until it seduced him from his priestly
vows; but it was a problem to the wary Frenchman
how to approach Amy. Though a submissive slave,
she was unapproachable; she answered no signs, nor
noticed the broken English addressed to her. She
shunned every one, and seemed to scorn sympathy
with her foes. Months passed, and still she toiled on
in Wiloma’s cabin, but her grief was not assuaged,
nor the fountain of her tears dried up. As spring came,
she would steal away by herself without the wigwam
to admire the opening buds, which filled the air with
their perfume, and with delight would listen to the
carol of birds, as they hopped merrily from branch to
branch, fit emblems of happiness. The cheerfulness
and beauty of all around her, contrasted strangely with
her own condition, but at times she would forget her
sadness, and soothed by the wild music of the waterfall,
lose herself in some day-dream of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Wiloma scarcely watched her captive. Indeed,
the thought of escape never entered the mind of Amy.
Where should she fly, when all she loved were in
heaven. True, she did not <span class='it'>know</span> that two of her
brothers were dead. The eldest, Winthrop, was at a
distant settlement at school; and little Johnny, the pet,
was sweetly sleeping in the chamber when they were
attacked, so it seemed certain that he was slain. But
the chance of life vanished when Richard fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy was one day sitting in the wigwam-door when
she saw Mordaunt coming toward her, and rose to
retire. “In the name of Jesus, tarry,” said he, in a
manner so earnest and imperative, that she stopped
involuntarily. “I have prayed for thee to the Holy
Virgin and the Saints,” continued he, crossing himself.
It was the first intelligible sentence in her own language
that Amy had heard since she parted with her
companions in misery. Some of the Indians spoke a
broken English that she understood, but she had never
heard Mordaunt utter a word before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need not thy prayers to thy saints,” said Amy,
after recovering from her astonishment, and recollecting
the teachings of her infancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak not lightly of prayers, child, thy soul hath
need of them,” said Mordaunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, but those now sleeping in death, taught
me that there is but One that heareth prayer,” said she,
her eyes filling with tears, “and He is our Father in
Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were heretics, and knew not the communion
of the true church,” said the Jesuit. “They
taught thee wrongly, child; and I fear their souls are
now suffering the pains of purgatory, but for thy sake
I would gladly pray them out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy’s eyes flashed indignantly. “That may be thy
portion, deceiver; but those of whom you speak,
killed by your murderous bands, are angels in heaven.
I know it,” said she, with an assurance that silenced
Mordaunt. “I saw them last night, they beckoned
me upward. Oh, Father, have mercy!” and she
lifted her eyes and hands heavenward, with an expression,
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
as if her soul were quitting its earthly tabernacle.
Mordaunt was awed. He sat silently gazing at her,
and she into the azure above. Old Wiloma, who had
been asleep in the wigwam, at this instant awoke, and
calling Amy, brought her wandering senses back to
earth. She rose and obeyed the bidding. Mordaunt
departed, but the expression of that upturned face
haunted him. There was a touching serenity about
Amy, as she gazed into the land of spirits, that commanded
his admiration. Duplicity had indeed made
him its disciple, but it had not entirely blunted his
perceptions of the beautiful; his coarse heart was not
impervious to a scene like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sought another interview, but Amy avoided him
more than ever after that conversation. Mordaunt
often visited old Wiloma’s cabin, for she had learned
the sign of the cross, but never could he gain an opportunity
of speaking with her who now had his
every thought. Cupid’s arrows were too deeply transfixed
to be withdrawn, and the more he was foiled,
the more necessary seemed the object he would gain.
One day Amy was walking in the woods, when Mordaunt
coming up hastily behind, surprised her with,
“My dear mademoiselle.” She could not retreat, and
had not time to reply, before his pent-up feelings found
utterance in the best English he could command. He
talked not of saints, or the “blessed Virgin.” He had
been seeking this opportunity too long, another was
too uncertain, and above all, he felt too deeply to
allow of any delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a broken and tremulous manner he told her of
his love; how his thoughts had dwelt upon her night
and day, and swore to be faithful forever, would she
but bless him with her affection. Amy’s countenance
indicated no participation in the confusion manifested
by Mordaunt. The color came and went upon his
cheek, as hope or fear predominated—a fitful anxiety
pervaded his whole frame. Nothing could have astonished
Amy more than the declarations of Mordaunt.
She had felt a decided aversion to him, without knowing
why, or having the slightest suspicion of his real
state of feeling. Her features were rigid, and bespoke
no emotion, her voice calm, and her whole manner
self-possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have given my heart to my own dear Richard,
and though he lives no more, I will not, I wish not to
recall it. Where he lies, there lie buried my earthly
hopes and affections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said he, “you are pining in this captivity—love
me, and I will rescue you. I will fly with you.
We will make our home amid the vine-clad hills of
France; I will be thy deliverer and protector, and
happiness shall crown thy days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am pining,” said Amy, “but it is not captivity
that makes me sigh; I grieve for that which thou canst
never restore; happiness has fled from my sad heart.
The world is desolate. This wilderness is lonely,
but even here nature has left witnesses of her loveliness,”
said she, pointing to the flowers at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But be my bride,” continued the impassioned
lover, “and forget thy troubles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! never! I <span class='it'>cannot</span> forget, I <span class='it'>would not</span> be
thy bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mordaunt saw in her firm, determined manner, the
death-blow to his bliss; but in her refusal there was
something so pensive, so mournfully beautiful, that it
set his soul on fire; he could not be refused—he begged
on, as wretches do for life, for one assurance of
her affection, but in vain. Flatteries, promises and
entreaties were alike to her—she spurned them all.
Mordaunt really loved Amy as purely as he was capable
of doing, and could he have gained her by persuasion,
the base passions of his soul might not have
been roused from their lethargy; but the object was
too precious to be abandoned until every expedient
was exhausted. Desire prompted him—there was one
art untried; principle deterred him not—he had no
honor to forbid. He knew Amy’s shrinking nature;
he had observed her tremble when the Indians approached
her, as if she dreaded contamination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proud girl,” said Mordaunt, “thou must marry
me or an Indian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Terrible alternative, but rather the savage than
thou, and rather death than either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” responded the Jesuit, seeming to be satisfied;
“thy fair form will pander to the appetite of
Manuki. He will exultingly gloat over his pale-faced
bride. <span class='it'>Thine is a good taste.</span> Mordaunt or the
savage.” The last sentence fell from his lips livid
with anger; but Amy noticed it not. Had a thunderbolt
flashed out from the clear sky above, she would
not have been more terrified than at this disclosure.
She had been more kindly treated than the other captives—but
was it for this? Was it that Manuki, he
who had torn her from her home, and murdered her
lover, should press her to his bosom? Once, indeed,
the appalling idea, that she might be forced to become
her captor’s wife had crossed her mind, but it was only
a momentary suspicion. Manuki had been gone for
weeks on a hunting excursion, and the thought had
never returned until now—but now all was clear;
Mordaunt had confirmed her worst fears; it must be
so—he had all the Indian’s secrets. The announcement
was awful. A ghastly paleness overspread her
face, and cold sweat stood upon her brow. She was
a picture of misery and despair. She uttered not a
sigh, but a crushing heart-sickness came over her, and
she resigned herself to her fate. The keen eye of the
priest marked the change. He thought the victim was
within his grasp, and slowly advancing with an air of
fiendish triumph, he took her gently by the hand,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor girl,” said he, “while Mordaunt lives thou
art safe. Love me, I will save you from that you so
much dread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she returned, “the Indian’s embrace would
be less terrible than thine, thou hollow-hearted seducer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was too much for Mordaunt. The two passions,
love and anger, drove him to desperation.
Firmly grasping her arm, he said through his clenched
teeth, “Heretic! thou canst not escape me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Amy seemed transformed; her eyes rolled
wildly in their orbits, and she quivered with anger.
In an instant Manuki and every thing connected with
her captivity was forgotten. One only thought took
possession of her soul, and that was of the priest before
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
her. Hitherto she had feared and hated, now she
despised him. She shook him from her, as if he had
been a viper, saying, as she drew herself up to her full
height, “Back, vile wretch, back! call upon thy saints,
count thy beads, and pray poor souls out of purgatory,
but touch me not—I know thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was said in a tone so imperious and commanding,
that Mordaunt, accustomed as he was implicitly to
obey superiors, shrunk involuntarily back, and Amy,
turning slowly around, walked away. But there was
so much of the heroic in her despair, so much loftiness
of spirit in her defiance, that he dared not follow.
He knew not why, but there was something in that
poor girl that awed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that night, memorable to York, when so many
closed their eyes in death, Amy and the Indians left
Richard Russell senseless, and, as they supposed, lifeless.
But He who holds the springs of life, had ordered
otherwise, and reserved him for future purposes. The
blow which prostrated, stunned him so completely,
that it effectually deceived his enemies. Mr. Wakefield’s
house was one of the first attacked, and some time
elapsed before the pillagers had finished their work,
and were ready to fire the village. Richard lay in an
oblivious insensibility for a while; but when partially
recovered, he opened his eyes, and discerned by the
flickering firelight the devastation around him. He
comprehended his situation, sprung to his feet, and
running out the back way, and creeping behind fences,
he escaped unobserved just as the flames were blazing
out from the neighboring cottages. A large hollow
tree stood near the fence back in the clearing, and
Richard bethought himself of this asylum. He crawled
until he reached it, and gave a long leap into its capacious
trunk, sinking into the snow, and heaping it over
his head. By this artifice he saved himself. He staid
there long after the sounds of savage warfare ceased,
until he was nearly frozen. At length exhuming himself,
he looked toward the village, but he saw nothing
save the consuming habitations—he heard nothing but
their crackling timbers. He soon ventured out, and
was going to warm himself, but when the scorching
heat struck his chilled body, it caused intense pain.
This, and the fear of some lurking foe, induced him to
direct his steps toward the nearest settlement. He ran
most of the way, rubbing and striking his almost torpid
limbs, else he had never survived to tell the woful tale
of his sufferings. Half dead from fear and pain, he
reached the neighboring colony. The kind settlers
bound up his wounds, and ministered to his wants. He
now, for the first time, began to feel his loss, and exposure
added to injuries and dejection, threw him into
a violent fever. For weeks he lay upon the borders
of the grave, the prey of racking pains and fierce delirium.
Sometimes he seemed struggling with an unseen
foe; at others he would call wildly upon Amy,
and anon beckoning, seemed to fancy her by his side,
and fall gently to sleep. At last the disease left him,
but he was helpless as an infant. Gradually he recovered
his strength, but months had passed, when he
again stept upon the earth. Health returned to Richard,
and with it came thoughts of Amy. From his best recollection
of her it seemed certain she was made a
captive. <span class='it'>She must be redeemed.</span> But was she alive?
Could she outlive the dangers of the journey she must
have taken, when he sunk under the few trials he endured?
Long months had elapsed. Had she been
burnt at the stake, or more probably, had she not been
sacrificed to the passions of the Indians? All these
were painful suspicions, which constantly forced themselves
upon his mind. But Hope, the “lover’s staff,”
as Shakespeare truly says, stayed him up. As soon as
he was able to ride on horseback, he started to find
Winthrop Wakefield, who was about fifty miles distant,
and the only one of all the inhabitants of York
whom he knew to be alive. By riding slowly he performed
the journey in a few days, and found Winthrop,
who was quite overjoyed to see him, and learn that
there was any reason to believe that Amy was still
alive. From what he had gathered from the uncertain
reports of the destruction of his native village, he supposed
himself both orphan and friendless. This seemed
confirmed by the fact that no tidings of any of his
family later than that fatal night had ever reached him.
Winthrop needed no persuasion to enter into a plan for
rescuing his only sister from her deplorable condition.
It wanted more eloquence to enlist others. All pitied
the misfortunes, and were interested in the deliverance
of the unhappy girl, and the other captives, if yet living:
But there were so many difficulties attending the project,
that to most it seemed entirely impracticable. The
general direction of the Abenakis they knew; but it
was a long and difficult expedition; the tribe was large,
and scattered over an extensive tract of country, and
they would be a feeble, unprotected band, without
knowing to what particular point to direct their efforts.
It was late in the spring—just the season when it was
absolutely necessary for every man to be upon his little
plantation to provide for the coming year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Peter the Hermit was not more indefatigable or
importunate than Richard. To him the crusade was
imperative, and the importance of the end to be secured
exceeded the perils of the enterprise. He at last succeeded
in inducing eight men from the different settlements
to accompany Winthrop and himself. Providing
for, and arming themselves as well as possible, they
started on their hazardous excursion. It was the beginning
of summer, and nature had on her gayest
mantle. Fragrant blossoms strewed their path, and
the groves were vocal with the melody of birds. As
they advanced new objects called forth their admiration.
The weather was fine, game was plenty, and
they met with no insurmountable obstacles. Their
march was much less tedious than they had anticipated.
A different history theirs from that of the gloomy passage
made by the captives the winter previous. When
they had arrived at the Penobscot, they were surprised
to find a man, whom they soon ascertained to be one
of the captives of York. Escaped from the Indians, he
had traveled many days, living on plants, twigs or roots,
without a gun or knife, with which to procure food or
defend himself. The poor man evinced the greatest
joy on meeting them, and offered to return and guide
them near where he conjectured Amy might be, though
he had not seen her during his captivity, and had no
positive knowledge concerning her. With more confidence
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
and renewed courage, they now pressed forward
rapidly, not a little stimulated and incited by the
melancholy narrations of their guide. He led them
until they heard the sound of the waterfall, when he
prudently concealed himself, knowing that he would
be a sure mark for the missiles of the vindictive savages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the last interview with Mordaunt, Amy was
distracted with tormenting fears. The more she thought
the more painful became her apprehensions of coming
evil. She knew she had made a bitter enemy of the
Frenchman, and his lowering visage, and uneasy,
troubled appearance, boded no good. She was each
day more strongly convinced of the truth of the frightful
intelligence he communicated. She knew the warriors
were to return during that moon, which was a festival
time with the Abenakis, and she felt assured Manuki
would then carry his designs into execution. Her
misery was now complete. Distressing surmises by
day, only gave place to horrid dreams during her unquiet
sleep at night. Amy resolved to attempt an escape.
She knew not where to go; she had a vague hope, but
no expectation of reaching the haunts of civilized men.
But, thought she, “I would welcome death in the
wilderness, with no covering but the leaves of the
forest, and no memorial save the flowers that would
spring from my dust, rather than life and pollution with
the Indians.” In this state of mind she left old Wiloma’s
cabin, as if for her customary walk, intending never
to return. She looked back toward the wigwam where
she had passed so many wretched hours, and breathed
a prayer for its old occupant, whom she had seen for the
last time. She had none but feelings of good will toward
Wiloma. She had suffered her to go and come when she
pleased, and treated her kindly in her own way, and
Amy felt something akin to regret on leaving her. She
bent her steps toward the waterfall, for as she often
walked there, it would excite no suspicion. It was a
beautiful afternoon in the latter part of June; every
thing animate, save herself, seemed rejoicing. Since
the day Mordaunt overtook her in the woods, she had
ventured but a few steps away from their hut. For two
or three days she had missed him, and presumed he had
gone to meet the returning party; nevertheless, she
wound her way along, cautiously, and afraid, starting
back from the springing partridge and flying hare,
timorous, as if each rustling leaf portended danger.
The cascade which Amy often visited, was, indeed, a
charming sight. It was produced by a little mountain-stream,
which came tumbling impetuously down a
ledge of rocks, and lost itself in foam. By the distance
and vehemence of its fall, rather than the volume of
water, it made the hills resound with its mimic thunder.
The predilection which the red men have ever manifested
for the roar of water, was probably the reason
why the principal rendezvous of the Abenakis had
been selected within the echo of this little cataract.
Amy seated herself upon the rocks, where she could
look into the sea of bubbles and diamonds below. The
roar of the cataract contrasted strangely with the quiet
of every thing around, but it was in harmony with her
own agitated heart, and its dashings drowned the tumult
of her spirit, and calmed its perturbations. She gathered
the rich hanging moss which grew in profusion about
her, and felt irresistibly enchained to the spot. Thus
spell-bound by the simple grandeur of the place,
she forgot for a time her perplexities, and even her
original intentions. Ah, little did she think danger or
deliverance were so near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving their guide, Richard and his party proceeded
in the direction indicated by the sound of the
waterfall. Their plan was to secrete themselves in
the cliffs about there, until they could discover if the
chief part of the Indians were away. If so, they
would fall upon the villages and secure the captives;
but should the “braves” be there, they must await
some more favorable opportunity. Advancing noiselessly,
they came up within sight of the cascade, when
a female figure attracted their attention. She was
loosely clad; a robe of hair, dripping with spray, hung
wildly down her shoulders, and, as she sat on a projecting
rock, seemed the genius of the place. The
keen eyes of Richard and Winthrop failed to recognize
Amy. Her dress was devoid of every thing
characteristic of civilization, and they thought her an
Abenaki maid; still, something led them to doubt it.
They halted, and Richard proposed to go forward
alone and ascertain who it was. He could not see her
face, but felt assured, as he advanced, that hers was
no Indian form. Could it be Amy, thought he, proceeding
less cautiously. Hearing his footsteps she
turned her head. One wild scream of joy, and she was
in Richard’s arms. That meeting! who could describe
its smiles and tears? “Absence, with all its
pains, was by that charming moment wiped away.”
To Amy it was a resurrection from the dead; to
Richard a long lost jewel found again. Winthrop’s
affectionate heart was not long in comprehending the
scene before him, and following Richard, he embraced
and kissed his sister again and again. Tears of
joy choked his utterance as he sobbed forth his delight.
Amy and Winthrop had passed the morn of life joyously
with each other; they “grew together, slept
together, learned, played, <a id='ate'></a>ate together,” sharing their
childish happiness and wo; and when Winthrop
heard the tidings of his family’s misfortunes, it was
the loss of Amy that brought forth his bitterest tears.
This meeting brought back the associations of days
gone by; but the past, as well as the present, was
clouded by the recollection that all those near and dear
had passed away, save only this, “his first love and
his last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy was not mistaken. Mordaunt <span class='it'>had</span> gone to
meet the returning Abenakis. They advanced with
shoutings, as usual, but the noise of the cataract overpowered
every thing beside, and the unguarded trio
were too much absorbed by their unexpected happiness
to think of safety. The reserve party heard the
yellings of the Indians, and foresaw the threatening
danger, but tried in vain to arrest the attention of
Richard and Winthrop. One of them bravely started
forward to warn them; but he had not advanced more
than a hundred paces when he saw the Indians emerging
from a little ravine opposite the falls, and sunk down
into the thicket. A shower of arrows was the first premonition
of their approach to the unfortunate dreamers.
One bruised Amy’s arm, one entered Richard’s hat and
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
grazed the top of his head, and one sunk deep into the
breast of Winthrop. “I am killed,” cried he, as the
fatal shaft pierced his vitals. Richard caught the gun
that lay at his side, and, fleeing, discharged it toward
their enemies. Amy, following him, ran until the
sounds of the Indians grew faint and distant, and convinced
them they were not pursued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Winthrop had run but a few steps when he fell
dead into the bushes, unobserved by his forward associates.
“Where is Winthrop?” asked Amy, as soon
as recollection returned. The last few moments had
too much happiness crowded into them—evil spirits
looked down with malignity, and a blight came over
the scene. But who shall tell the frighted Amy that
Winthrop is no more? They listened—there seemed
a howling joined with the roar of the falls. A thrill of
horror passed over Amy as she thought that her poor
brother might have fallen, wounded, into the hands of
their foes. Exasperated at her loss, he would find far
less humanity than she had experienced. Still that
moaning sound continued and increased. Richard
climbed a tall tree, thinking he might hear more distinctly,
and perhaps discern what it was. What was
his amazement when he found that his position enabled
him to see the Indians—for in their hasty flight
they had not noticed their ascent of a hill. He saw
them crossing the stream below the waterfall. There
were a multitude of them near together, winding their
way upon the rocks. Richard had an acute, far vision;
he never exerted it more than now. The howling
swelled upon the breeze—what were they doing?
“Oh, Heavens!” murmured he, “it is Winthrop.”
They seemed carrying a man, and occasionally he
could distinguish the face of a white person. He looked
again and again—it was not a red man. But then,
thought he, would they be mourning over a slain enemy?
It must be for a captive lost. They were crossing
from the same side on which they had first seen
them. There had not been sufficient time, and there
could be no motive for crossing and recrossing with a
dead enemy; more probably they would leave him to
the wolves. But one thing was certain—Amy and
himself were in danger, and would be pursued. He
quickly descended, and taking her concealed themselves
in a clump of cedars growing thick and full
from the ground. So close was the covert that a
pointer could scarcely have found them. “Where is
Winthrop?” said Amy, imploringly. Richard dared
not—could not tell her his fears, but spoke cheerly, and
whispering of love she soon forgot every thing but her
lover and her joy in seeing him once more. But the
more Richard considered upon what he saw from the
tree, the more inexplicable it appeared, and he resolved
to relate it to Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said she, “it was Mordaunt, that dead body;
and for him they were mourning. That random shot
of yours killed their priest, wicked, miserable Mordaunt.
You, Richard, have avenged my wrongs,”
continued she, bursting into tears at the remembrance
of her insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that accounts for all—their carrying the body,
their howling, and not pursuing us,” said Richard,
still dwelling upon the sight and sounds of the afternoon.
“But dry up your tears, my sweet Amy; deliverance
and happiness have come at last,” and he
strained her in ecstasy to his bosom. But the transport
of her lover’s embrace soon gave way to grievous
apprehensions for the welfare of her favorite and now
only brother. “We will go and seek him and our
party,” said Richard. “The Indians will scarcely follow
us now; the burial of their priest will occupy
them too much to think of pursuit.” It was dim twilight
when they crept forth from their hiding place.
They had gone but a little distance when they heard a
whistle, which started Mary, but which Richard understood
was from one of his comrades, and soon they
saw a moving figure near them. This proved to be
the man who had vainly endeavored to warn them of
their peril before their attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Winthrop?” asked Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! my poor young woman,” said the kind, honest
man, “I hate to grieve you, if you do not know it,
but I saw the dear lad fall by the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me where he lies,” said the shocked, terrified
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May be I can,” said the man. “I was looking for
some one to come with me, when I heard you and
whistled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way and they followed silently, except
the exclamations of grief that ever and anon broke
from Amy. They had nearly reached the falls, the
sight of which recalled the few delightful moments
spent with Winthrop, when their leader, stooping
down into a bunch of alder, said—“Poor, brave boy,
here he lies.” It was not yet dark; the pale twilight
just revealed his pale, dead face, his garments dyed
with blood, and the murderous arrow still deep in his
breast. Amy kissed his cold, pallid cheeks, and bathed
them in tears. “My ransom was too dearly paid,”
said she bitterly. “Why was Winthrop, so happy, so
noble and so young, the one to fall by savage hands,
when death would have been sweet to me, their
wretched slave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy
sight,” ejaculated their pious companion. “Clouds
and darkness are about His throne, but He doeth all
things well. We must not linger here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Richard bore the dead body, and Amy followed,
until they heard a signal, which told them they were
in the vicinity of their party. They halted, and their
friends gathered around them. The object before them
disclosed the tragical history of the afternoon, and they
mingled their tears for one whom they all loved. The
full moon rose, and looked down through the forest
trees upon that weeping band. The head of the dead
Winthrop rested upon Amy’s lap. He was even yet
beautiful—the lustre of his eye was gone, but the clustering
curls still lay life-like upon his placid brow, and
his features were tranquil as if he were sleeping.
There they sat, surrounding him, “dumb as solemn
sorrow ought to be.” At last a low voice fell upon
the air, and prayer arose from that stricken group—such
prayer as only ascends from the dependent, helpless
and bereaved wanderer in the wilderness. Comforted
and refreshed, they removed the fatal dart, brought
water from a spring and washed the body of poor Winthrop,
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
wrapped it in a blanket, and buried his bloody
garments. They resolved to relieve each other by
turns, and carry the body with them until morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know they cannot hurt his corpse,” said Richard,
“but let us take it out of the enemy’s country.
He would have performed the like service for any of
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An affecting sight was that funeral train. That solitary
female, bent like a drooping flower by the tempest
of grief that had swept over her, the chief mourner,
followed close behind the dead, borne without coffin or
bier. All that night they walked in slow procession,
the stillness only broken by the occasional sobs of Amy,
when her overwhelming grief burst its barriers afresh.
There was a “mournful eloquence” in that mute sorrow.
It bespoke deeper emotion than the clamorous
wailings of the Indians over their dead. The moon
sunk behind the hills, and the quiet stars shed their
mild radiance upon them, until their twinklings were
lost in the light of the breaking morn. Weary and sad,
they were cheered by the signs of returning day, and
by faith the pilgrims hailed it as the blest harbinger of
the resurrection morn, when, after the long night of
death has passed, the final trump will awake the
righteous to “life immortal in the skies.” Just as the
silver clouds began to streak the east, they reached a
beautiful green slope, with but few trees and a gentle
streamlet bounding two sides of it. They stopped—every
one seemed impressed with the fitness of the
place for the burial. Amy first broke the silence, exclaiming,
“It is a lovely spot!” but as they proceeded
to lay down their unconscious burthen, she commenced
weeping, and said, “Will you leave Winthrop here?”
She uncovered his head and again pillowed it in her
lap, kissing and caressing it, as if, perchance, she might
awaken a smile upon that ghastly face, then mourning
as if her heart would break when attracted toward
the grave they were preparing for him. It was under
a spreading oak that they chose his resting place. The
earth around was carpeted with flowers, the rivulet
gliding below, and the place was in unison with the
young and beauteous form they were about to entomb
there. They finished their work—they brought shrubs
and flowers and sprinkled in the grave, and wrapped
their cherished one in his rude pall and laid him in the
narrow bed. They knelt around, Richard supporting
Amy, who seemed to forget every thing but that form
so soon to be buried forever from her sight. The same
good man who led their supplications the evening before,
was now their chaplain, and his prayer brought
holy consolation to the hearts of the afflicted. He
spoke of the blessedness of the dead, who had passed
from the cares of earth and entered “the mansions of
rest above.” He prayed most fervently for the living,
who would, if faithful, soon partake of the same
glory. When they arose death seemed disarmed of
his terrors, and Heaven appeared <span class='it'>very</span> near. They
covered their companion with boughs and fresh earth,
and Amy cheerfully brought honey-suckles and strewed
over his grave. The sun had begun to pour his mellow
beams over the wakening world when, with grateful
and subdued hearts, they bade a final farewell to the
burial place of Winthrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What though they left him without guard or memorial,
alone in the wilderness! Kind hands had laid him
there, prayer had hallowed the spot, tears of affection
bedewed his grave, and guardian spirits would watch
with jealous care his “sleeping dust.” “Rest, thee, my
brother, last of my kindred,” said Amy, sending a lingering
look backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sofuk, the Sheik of the Shammar Arabs, was the owner of a mare of matchless beauty, called, as if the property of
the tribe, the Shammeriyah. Her dam, who died about ten years ago, was the celebrated Kubleh, whose renown extended
from the sources of the Khabour to the end of the Arabian promontory, and the day of whose death is the epoch
from which the Arabs of Mesopotamia now date the events concerning their tribe. Mohammed Emir, Sheik of the
Jebour, assured me that he had seen Sofuk ride down the wild ass of the Sinjar on her back, and the most marvelous
stories are current in the desert as to her fleetness and powers of endurance. Sofuk esteemed her and her daughter
above all the riches of the tribe; for her he would have forfeited all his wealth, and even Amsha herself.</p>

<p class='line0'>The wild boars of the Tigris they had slain,</p>

<p class='line0'>The well had dried; her fierce, impatient eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Glared red and sunken, and her slight young limbs</p>
<p class='line0'>Were lean with thirst. He checked his camel’s pace,</p>

<p class='line0'>Through floating drapery, on the buoyant air.</p>

<p class='line0'>Died, while the fire was yet in all her limbs⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Died for the life of Sofuk, whom she loved.</p>
<p class='line0'>The base Jebours—on whom be Allah’s curse!⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Came on his path, when far from any camp,</p>
<p class='line0'>And would have slain him, but that Kubleh sprang</p>
<p class='line0'>Against the javelin points, and bore them down,</p>
<p class='line0'>And gained the open Desert. Wounded sore,</p>
<p class='line0'>She urged her light limbs into maddening speed</p>
<p class='line0'>And made the wind a laggard. On and on</p>
<p class='line0'>The red sand slid beneath her, and behind</p>
<p class='line0'>Whirled in a swift and cloudy turbulence,</p>
<p class='line0'>As when some star of Eblis, downward hurled</p>
<p class='line0'>By Allah’s bolt, sweeps with its burning hair</p>
<p class='line0'>The waste of darkness. On and on, the bleak,</p>
<p class='line0'>Bare ridges rose before her, came and passed,</p>
<p class='line0'>And every flying leap with fresher blood</p>
<p class='line0'>Her nostril stained, till Sofuk’s brow and breast</p>
<p class='line0'>Were flecked with crimson foam. He would have turned</p>
<p class='line0'>To save his treasure, though himself were lost,</p>
<p class='line0'>But Kubleh fiercely snapped the brazen rein.</p>
<p class='line0'>At last, when through her spent and quivering frame</p>
<p class='line0'>The sharp throes ran, our hundred tents arose,</p>
<p class='line0'>And with a neigh, whose shrill excess of joy</p>
<p class='line0'>O’ercame its agony, she stopped and fell.</p>
<p class='line0'>The Shammar men came round her as she lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>And Sofuk raised her head and held it close</p>
<p class='line0'>Against his breast. Her dull and glazing eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Met his, and with a shuddering gasp she died.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then like a child his bursting grief made way</p>
<p class='line0'>In passionate tears, and with him all the tribe</p>
<p class='line0'>Wept for the faithful mare.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They dug her grave</p>
<p class='line0'>Amid Al-Hather’s marbles, where she lies</p>
<p class='line0'>Buried with ancient kings; and since that time</p>
<p class='line0'>Was never seen, and will not be again,</p>
<p class='line0'>O Arabs, though the world be doomed to live</p>
<p class='line0'>As many moons as count the desert sands,</p>
<p class='line0'>The like of wondrous Kubleh. God is great!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was a transient dweller in a strange land—one distant
from my childhood’s home, and far away from
those who knew me first and loved me best. Gradually,
as the vivid excitements of life had surrounded
me, as new ties had sprung up and old hopes faded, I
had lost the intimate knowledge of the welfare or the
afflictions of many who had formerly been familiar
friends, and a lengthened separation had produced that
ignorance of the details of their destiny frequently occurring,
even where affection still lingers unaltered.
But there are periods when, as it were, remembrance
irresistibly presses upon us, and we all have seasons
when old times and buried associations crowd around
us with inexplicable distinctness—when the actual
loses for a while its absorbing interest, and the past,
with all its radiant dreams, its rainbow illusions, is enchanting
reality once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sitting alone, at the close of a lovely autumn
afternoon, before an open window, my fancy busy
with the throng of older associations, and inattentive to
the beautiful view stretching beneath me, strikingly
fair as were its features, now glowing through the
crimsoning sunlight. But something—I know not
what, for such glimpses are among the spirit’s mysteries—had
recalled other times, and my soul communed
with itself and was still. The mind has its own restless
and concealed creation—its hidden world of active
silentness; and to those who have battled with the depression
attendant on human experience, there is untold
luxury in reveling amid the crowding memories
that “longest haunt the heart.” Even as I sat thus
idly reflecting, a paper reached me, sent by some
friendly hand from my early home, and earnestly as I
would have read a loving letter, I <a id='pored'></a>pored over the contents
of that every-day record. It spoke to me as a
messenger from the absent; each well-known name
mentioned in its columns, held a thousand clustering
reminiscences for me; the trivial local news was like
welcome household tidings; and I spoke aloud the old
familiar names I had not heard for years, as if a spell
lay in their sound. Last of all I turned to the page
where, side by side, were chronicled marriages and
deaths. The first were those of strangers; among the
last was noticed the final departure of one whom I
had once loved, as we only love in the purity of youth.
The announcement was worded in the usual form with
which we herald to the careless world that a soul has
gone to the mysterious future. Nothing was there to
arrest the contemplation of the reader—to speak of inevitable
human destiny to a throbbing human heart—to
reveal the agony of mortality, the bitterness of death,
or the trials of the wearily burdened and loving ones,
perchance well-nigh borne down by that one event.
“Died at sea, during her homeward voyage, Mary
Vere, aged 24, for three years a resident missionary in
Persia.” And this was all! The ending of the saddest
life I ever knew, the knell of as pure a spirit as
was ever bowed and fettered by earthly cares—this
was the cold, brief recording of the history of a warm
nature, that had patiently toiled and uncomplainingly
suffered—that even in its youth had been old in grief—that
had wandered abroad and found no rest, and then,
like a wounded bird, had winged its way homeward to
die! Ah, Mary! little dreamed we, in our sunny days,
that mine eyes should ever trace the chronicle of such
a destiny for thee!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had first met, in childhood, at the country residence
of a friend, where we were both spending the
summer months. She accompanied her mother—her
only surviving parent, then slowly declining in the last
stage of consumption. Mary and myself, thrown continually
together, without other companions, speedily
became warm friends, though her pensive, irresolute
disposition, had little in common with my natural impetuous
animation. She had been the attendant on
suffering from her earliest recollection, for her father
had died after a lingering illness, during which he had
desired the constant enlivenment of his only child’s
society, and her mother had for years been a resigned
but hopeless invalid. All who have closely observed
children, are aware of the influence such things half-unconsciously
exert over minds susceptible to every
impression, and it was not strange that one so used to
look on sorrow, should have learned at last to doubt
the very existence of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary was a strikingly beautiful child, with dark,
soul-revealing eyes, bright with the mystical fire of the
burning thoughts within. I well remember their rapturous
expression when she was excited by some tale
of heroism—for she was full of a strange, quiet <a id='enth'></a>enthusiasm,
that wasted itself in fruitless sympathy with the
moral greatness of others, but shrank with painful distrust
from reliance on its own impulsive guidance.
She was quick of feeling, and easily touched by the
most trivial deed of kindness, and her being was too
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
sensitive for her ever to be thoughtlessly happy. Her
look and manner were peculiarly winning in their tranquil,
subdued gentleness; and when this was, occasionally,
though rarely, laid aside for awhile, amid the
irrepressible mirth of childish amusement, her laugh
had the ringing, silvery melody which seems the musical
essence of enjoyment. For two successive summers
we met and were inseparably intimate, and then
four years elapsed before we were again together.
During this interval Mary’s mother died, and she went
far from my home, to reside with a distant relation.
We had, from our first parting, corresponded regularly,
and her letters were, like herself, poetical and visionary.
I know not wherefore, for she wrote no murmur, but
they left the impression that she was not satisfied with
her new home, and my heart yearned to comfort her,
to remove from her lot its loneliness, from her soul its
dimness. But she shrunk, with what then appeared to
me morbid delicacy, from all approach to confidence
on this subject, and gradually grew in all things less
communicative regarding herself, as if doubting the response
of sympathy. There was evidently a constraint
placed on her spontaneous emotions—a quiet
concealment of her deeper interests, which to me
spoke mournfully, and recalled that silent, dejected
consciousness of mental and spiritual solitude, which
is the saddest portion and the most touching consequence
of an orphan’s unshared and melancholy destiny.
It was not until long afterward that I learned
the domestic trials and annoyances to which she had
been subjected, and the dreary, joyless routine in which
she dragged on the years that should have been her
brightest ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with many a sweet anticipation of friendly,
unreserved intercourse and affectionate solace—such
dreams as are borne by loving angels to hearts strong
in youth and rich in tenderness, that I looked impatiently
forward to my next meeting with my old playmate,
for now we had both glided from childhood to
womanhood, and the firm bond was between us that
links those who remember together. I shall never forget
my astonishment when, after our first fond and impetuous
greeting, I turned, with tearful eyes, to mark
the alteration time had wrought in the appearance of
my companion. She was calm and composed, almost
to coldness, and there was no visible exhibition of the
agitation struggling beneath, or of all the afflicting reminiscences
which I knew were recalled by looking on
my face again. She had grown from the timid, irresolute
girl, to the proud, self-possessed woman, and her
manner had the tranquil air of one aware of her own
moral strength, and of the existence of impulses and
feelings too pure and sacred to be lightly displayed to a
world which had nothing in common with them. She
was more beautiful than ever, and I have never seen a
being whose polished, intellectual tranquillity was so
faultlessly graceful. She had acquired the early maturity
of mind given in kindness to those who are tried
in their youth; for she had evidently “thought too
long and darkly;” her feelings were still from their intensity,
and hers was the reflective repose which, wearied
and desponding, folds its drooping pinions and
sleeps on the bosom of darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, me! it is a dreary thing to feel alone in the
world—to have no eye brighten at our coming, no voice
ever ready with its eager welcoming, nothing to tell us
we are beloved, and that fond thoughts and wishes are
around our onward pathway. O, ye who have never
felt this worst of desolations—ye whose best affections
bind ye still, who have no link broken, no yearnings
unfulfilled, fold to your hearts the precious blessing
that lives in domestic ties and speaks in household
love, and greet kindly and gently those whose life is
lonely—who look around them and find no answering
gaze, who pine with many tears for one glimpse of the
tenderness whose living light is daily yours, who go
forward sadly and silently, with none to love them,
save those who are angels in Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is a romance in every one’s experience,
evanescent though it be; and at length its bright change
rose upon Mary’s existence. I heard she was soon to
be married, to a young clergyman, of whom all spoke
in terms of approval and admiration. I sincerely rejoiced
at an event so calculated to relieve at once her
perplexities and regrets, and to summon sweet visions
for one who had too long lived without affection in the
world. I wrote to her, expressing all I felt—all my
fervent hopes for her dawning welfare. I longed impatiently
for her answer, anxious to discover if she realized
as I wished the brighter career opening before
her; but several weeks wended on, and brought me
no reply. It was from another source I learned the
dangerous and protracted illness of her lover, and a
paper, tremulously directed by Mary’s hand, at length
informed me of his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally a letter came, with its black seal. It was
the last farewell of one who loved me—the last pouring
forth of tenderness from a heart that was broken;
and yet, sorrowful as those lines were, they spoke of
hopes unshadowed and immortal—of a pilgrimage
troubled and toilsome, but full of reward, and of all an
enthusiast’s delusive anticipations in the sacred enterprise
before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wrote on the eve of her departure from her native
land, and with her singular, acquired shrinking
from the avowal of her feelings, she made no allusion
to the connection recently broken; and not a word revealed
the grief that clouded over her fairest prospects
and sent her forth an exile. Frequently afterward
I saw her name mentioned as one of unwavering
zeal in her adopted cause, and faithfully devoted to
the laborious responsibilities of her mission. But between
herself and her early friends a gulf seemed to be,
perhaps because she did not wish to revive the over-powering
recollections of the past. The absence of all
communication with those once dear to her, must have
been intentional, for she was not one to forget. Three
years of this unbroken existence of care and labor had
gone by, and then I had thus accidentally learned the
mournful doom of a being endowed with all earth’s
purest impulses, yet so soon recalled from its wanderings.
Hers is no uncommon history—for many such
are on our daily annals. O! give them kind thoughts
and words, for these are the sad heart’s treasured
gems!</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CONDOR. (<span class='it'>Sarcoramphus Gryphus.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is one of the largest of the vultures. The
early Spanish writers on America gave the most exaggerated
accounts of its size and strength; and its
true history and dimensions have been only recently
ascertained. The bird was compared with the Roc of
the Arabian romance writers. Acosta says that the
bird called Condor is able singly to eviscerate and devour
a whole sheep or a calf. Garcilaso de la Vega
makes them measure 16 feet from tip to tip of the extended
wings; he says their beaks are sufficiently
strong to perforate and tear off a bull’s hide, and to rip
out its entrails; and that a single Condor “will set
upon and slay boys of ten or twelve years;” which
last exaggeration, though now exploded, has found its
way into our common school geographies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Investigation has shown that the Condor is merely a
large, perhaps not the largest of the vultures. “The
Condor,” writes Mr. Bennett, “forms the type of a
genus, a second species of which is the <span class='it'>Vultur papa</span>
of Linnæus, the king of the vultures of British writers.
They are both peculiar to the New World, but approach
in their most essential characters very closely
to the vultures of the Old Continent, differing from the
latter principally in the large, fleshy, or rather cartilaginous,
caruncle which surmounts their beaks, in the
large size of their oval and longitudinal nostrils, placed
almost at the very extremity of the cere; and in the
comparative length of their quill feathers, the third
being the longest of the series. The most important
of these differences, the size and position of their nostrils,
appears to be well calculated to add to the already
highly powerful sense of smell possessed by the typical
vulture, and for which the birds have been almost proverbially
celebrated from the earliest ages. There is
also a third species, the Californian vulture, two noble
specimens of which, the only pair in Europe, are preserved
in the London Zoological Society’s Museum,
rivaling the Condor in bulk, and agreeing in every respect
with the generic characters of the group, except
in the existence of the caruncle, of which they are entirely
destitute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In size the Condor is little, if at all, superior to the
Bearded Griffin, the Lämmergeyer of the Alps, with
which Buffon was disposed conjecturally to confound
it, but to which it bears at most but a distant relation.
The greatest authentic measurement scarcely carries
the extent of its wings beyond fourteen feet, and it
appears rarely to attain so gigantic a size. M. Humboldt
met with none that exceeded nine feet, and was
assured by many credible inhabitants of the province
of Quito that they had never shot any that measured
more than eleven. The length of a male specimen
somewhat less than nine feet in expanse was three
feet three inches from the tip of the beak to the extremity
of the tail; and its height, when perching with
the neck partly withdrawn, two feet eight inches. Its
beak was <a id='two'></a>two inches and three quarters in length, and
an inch and a quarter in depth when closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
“The beak of the Condor is straight at the base, but
the upper mandible becomes arched toward the point,
and terminates in a strong and well curved hook. The
basal half is of an ash brown, and the remaining portion,
toward the point, is nearly white. The head and
neck are bare of feathers, and covered with hard,
wrinkled, dusky reddish skin, on which are scattered
some short brown or blackish hairs. On the top of
the head, which is much flattened above, and extending
some distance along the beak, is attached an oblong
firm caruncle or comb, covered by a continuation
of the skin which invests the head. This organ is
peculiar to the male. It is connected to the beak only
in its anterior part, and is separated from it at the base
in such a manner as to allow a free passage of the air
to the large oval nostrils, which are situated beneath
it at that part. Beyond the eyes, which are somewhat
elongated, and not sunk beneath the general surface of
the head, the skin of the neck is, as it were, gathered
into a series of descending folds, extending obliquely
from the back of the head over the temples, to the
under side of the neck, and there connected anteriorly
with a lax membrane or wattle, capable of being dilated
at pleasure, like that of the common turkey. The
neck is marked by numerous deep parallel folds, produced
by the habit of retracting the head, in which the
bird indulges when at rest. In this position scarcely
any part of the neck is visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Round the lower part of the neck both sexes, the
female as well as the male, are furnished with a broad
white ruff of downy feathers, which forms the line of
separation between the naked skin above and the true
feathers covering the body below it. All the other
feathers, with the exception of the wing coverts, and
the secondary quill feathers, are of a bright black,
generally mingled with a grayish tinge of greater or
less intensity. In the female the wing coverts are
blackish gray; but the males have their points, and
frequently as much as half their length, white. The
wings of the latter are consequently distinguished from
those of the female by their large white patches. The
secondary quill feathers of both sexes are white on
the outer side. The tail is short and wedge shaped.
The legs are excessively thick and powerful, and are
colored of a blueish gray, intermingled with whitish
streaks. Their elongated toes are united at the base
by a loose but very apparent membrane, and are terminated
by long black talons of considerable thickness,
but very little curved. The hinder toe is shorter than
the rest, and its talon, although more distinctly curved,
is equally wanting in strength, a deficiency which renders
the foot much less powerful as an organ of prehension
than that of any other of the large birds of the
raptorial order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Condor is found in various parts of the vast
mountain chain on the western border of the American
continent, but it is most common in Peru and <a id='chile'></a>Chile.
Its habitation is most frequently at an elevation of
10,000 or 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, and
there these birds are seen in groups of three or four,
but never in large companies like the true vultures.
Some of the mountain peaks bear names which in the
Indian tongue mean Condor’s Look-out, Condor’s
Roost and Condor’s Nest. Two of them will attack
a vicuna, a heifer or even a puma, and overcome it
by repeated strokes of their beaks and talons. When
gorged, says Humboldt, they sit sullen and sombre on
the rocks; and when thus overloaded with food they
will suffer themselves to be driven before the hunter
rather than take wing. They do not attack men or
even children, although it is admitted that two of them
would be a match for a powerful man without
weapons. Sir Francis Head gives an amusing account
of a contest between one of his Cornish miners and a
gorged Condor, which lasted an hour, and terminated
in the escape of the bird.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LIGHTS AND SHADOWS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Jeremy.</span>—I presume you are shaking the
spray from your locks, and are over head and ears in love
with salt water, while I am among the weeping willows
in these days of hydrophobia, when water—that we cannot
get at—provokes a feeling of madness. You glory in a
proprietorship over which your plough passes, turning up
soil that is all your own, while the nodding grain, golden
and pulpy, ripens in your absence for your abundant
granaries, while I cultivate this, my small patch, “a
tenant at will,” whose harvest of gleaning would be blown
to the winds without a painstaking care and watchfulness.
You are the lord of acres, while I wander around forbidden
enclosures, and look upon many a Castle of Indolence
longing but for a yard of ground all my own, upon which
to plant a firm foot, to sound the challenge and cry—war!
The very utterness of poverty is grandeur and riches,
compared to the feeling of having the pent-up energies
which have found a full outlet in enterprise, growing fiery
in inaction, and panting for room, continually battling at
the heart, and knocking in vain for freedom and exercise.
But if you have ever felt the utter insignificance of
wealth and high advantage combined with indolence and
inactivity, and forever do-nothingness, before the godlike
attributes of persevering energy and indomitable will, you
have felt the pride of manhood in its full force and power.
You have reaped in anticipation the rewards of high
courage, of manly resolve, of personal industry and victory.
You have enjoyed in your day-dreams the full
fruition of assured success—and awoke to hope on, to resolve
and to conquer. Consider me, my dear Jeremy, as
winding myself up for the next seven years, after having
run down—as having stopped, if you please, to blow; and
while you are luxuriating in the surf, and shaking the briny
water from your shoulders, as throwing off surfdom, with
a defiant air, and a determined purpose of taking a few
strides forward, to meet that “good time a coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who does not love the sound of the breakers at Cape
May, who has once listened to their wild melody? What a
chance for love-making is the evening stroll upon the beach.
On the one side the rugged bank, on which the white houses
sit like a flock of wild-birds suddenly alighted, and the
faint twinkle of rush-like lights dancing like fire-flies in
the night air; on the other, the wild waters—sad emblem
of the wild unrest of the human heart—their huge waves
reflecting from their sides the quiet light of the moon,
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
while the white-caps come trooping in, like a squadron
of dragoons, with their plumes dancing, and a roar, as if
the tread of an army were near, and a thousand park of
artillery were booming in the distance. The music of
rich voices hushed amid the uproar—the light of kind eyes
sparkling with a subdued eloquence—the loved face impressively
thoughtful, indicating that God has laid his
hand upon the heart, and whispered amid the tumult of
its worldly thoughts, “be thou still!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was my good fortune to see both Cape May and the
Falls of Niagara, for the first time, by moonlight, and
whether the hush of evening naturally associated in the
mind with twilight, deepened the impressions of awe and
wonder with which I gazed upon them, or to the greatness
of the novelty was added through the misty twilight,
a dim religious sanctity to the impression, I know not, but
they have never since charmed me so much in the broad
glare of day, as in the evening, with a quiet moon looking
placidly down upon the flashing foam, seemingly rebuking
the uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bathers, too, at mid-day, screaming like sea-birds
amid the surf, with their many-colored garments dancing
amid the foam—beauty floating upon the breakers as calmly
as if reposing upon the virgin snow of her own pillows.
Manhood breasting the billow, and riding securely far out
where the huge porpoise rolls lazily along, while tiny
feet go patting, and tiny hands go clapping along the shore,
the very idleness and luxury of the sport impressing upon
the beholder a sense of enjoyment, a feeling of relief from
the work-day world, a consciousness of manhood and
freedom above the value of dollars—a heart eased of the
oppressiveness of brick and mortar, and open to a sense
most acute of the very luxury of being idle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Philadelphians had made half as much of Cape May
as the New Yorkers have of Saratoga, or the Yankees
have of Newport, its visiters from all parts of the country
would number tens of thousands; but I question whether
its present character of being Philadelphia in holyday
dress, let loose for a romp, does not add much to its charms.
The relief from absurd ceremony, where every face is
familiar. The easy, unrestrained life, the freedom of remark
and retort, and the exuberant gayety of the whole
company, add to the enjoyment of the place, and make it
a home in a family circle greatly enlarged and full of good
humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, my dear Jeremy, you must have observed that at
Cape May we got along comfortably, without the towering
and overshadowing influence of the “upper ten thousand,”
which stands up to be worshiped by the people
without money or <span class='it'>brains</span>. It might be a serious question,
how long a man may exist, with great self-complacency,
without <span class='it'>heart</span>, or intellect, yet with a purse well lined
with gold—regarding the world of men and of matter as
especially made for him—the lord paramount of the soil,
and of the sinews, which of right belong to his betters.
Cannot some one curious in nature and philosophy, analyze
one of this genus, and tell the world how the appearance
of humanity can be preserved without a single attribute
of it, existing life-like and active in his breast. The
whole effort of this air-drawn animal appears to be to
rise, to get up in society, to overlook the pigmies who toil
and sweat for bread—to loose his identity in the upper
circle, that he may forget his grandfather, the soap-boiler,
upon whose bubbles he has been shot upward—as we expel
a pea from an air-gun. Prick the bubble, and the
thing vanishes into air, without leaving behind him a
trace of existence of the value of a pepper-corn, and <span class='it'>so</span>,</p>

<p class='noindent'>The gifts of <span class='sc'>God</span> are equal. He sheds upon us all the
same glorious sunlight, and gives us the same heritage
of dew and showers. The air has no monopolist, but its
balmy odors as kindly kiss as well the beggar as the king.
The mountain stream and the mountain flower acknowledge
no master but the hand that formed them. The very
beast that roams over the boundless prairies, and tosses
his wild mane to the breeze, snuffs in an atmosphere sanctified
by its freeness. God, over all his own works sheds
the benignant light of universal benevolence and goodwill.
The hues of a heaven-tinted charity blend kindly
together the world over—the laws of a love undistinguishing
are impressed upon all nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is <span class='it'>man</span>—but a handful of his mother earth—that
wrongs her kind bosom, and says to his brother, stand
aside, the heritage is mine—we are not equals in birth-right.
I claim by pre-emption a supremacy which makes
me thy master. The very purple I wear, when contrasted
with the faded russet of thy poor garb, makes me thy lord.
The jeweled rings of these fingers clasp thy neck, and
make thee bondsman. Thou shalt go at my bidding and
come at my call. Thou shalt toil until thy weary bones
crack, to pamper to my luxurious desires! Thou shalt not
even <span class='it'>think</span> but at thy peril! By the high authority of
what is called <span style='font-size:smaller'>LAW</span>, thou art enslaved!</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this right of <span class='it'>law</span>, how many wrongs are done,
which the cold eye of day gazes on in silence, whilst
hearts wrung with anguish weep on unpitied. This strong
arm, when its fist clutches dollars, how terrible is it in its
willingness to crush and overwhelm the unsheltered, the
unbefriended, the poor, unpitied victim. But if a breast
sparkling with diamonds interposes, how palsied and feeble
becomes the blow—<span class='it'>the justice, the equity of the law</span>, how
considerate and kind!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet law, according to the lawgiver, “is the perfection
of reason,” which must account, I suppose, for the difficulty
which the learned counsel experiences in expounding it
to an “intelligent jury.” The poor thief therefore remains
in profound ignorance of the equity of the decision,
by which he is consigned to three years of penitence is
solitary confinement, while his gayer brother in crime
dashes through the streets with his carriage and scarlet
housings, basking in the worship of wondering and approving
eyes, <span class='it'>his</span> penalty for having started a bank, <span class='it'>and
stopped it</span>, by which thousands of poor men lost the dollars
which paid for the equipage, and furnished the viands for
his pampered appetite, the meanest of which would have
driven starvation from their doors. He is beyond the law.
Let an hundred operatives agree in thinking that the
wretched pittance for their daily labor will not suffice to
feed the mouths of a half dozen famishing children, the law
has its kind and protecting eye upon them at once—and if
they <span class='it'>dare</span> express so infamous a sentiment, it immediately
takes care of them as conspirators. But the masters of an
hundred mills may openly avow their determination to
close their doors and send starvation into a whole village,
the law instantly closes its watchful eye, and dozes over
the scene, deeming it right and proper that capital should
be indulged in its absurdities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Should John, upon the box of a gentleman’s carriage,
come in contact with the hub of the humble cab of Jehu,
and thereby disfigure the carriage and irritate the temper
of the great owner, his honor, who may have had <span class='it'>dealings</span>
with him, deals with Jehu, who is glad to get off for his
five dollars, and thinks it a kindness that he is not imprisoned
for the intolerable crime of John not giving an
inch of the road to a vulgar cabman. When diamonds are
trumps, take care of knaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a fiction of law—for even “perfect reason” has her
fictions, it seems—that people who are standing at a distance
in a riot, are as culpable as those who are throwing
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
the brickbats—and it is certain they are the more likely to
be killed, probably from a humane feeling of not wishing
to irritate those who are too near—and it is for this reason,
we presume, that after the riot is over, a number of citizens,
against whom nothing can be proved, are arrested, to
assert the majesty of the law, while the real rioters and
murderers are perfectly unknown to the police. The law
being discriminative thus administered, as well as stringent
when necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great names, which provoke a riot, or lack the nerve
and manliness to suppress it, have an overshadowing influence,
which awes even the majesty of the law—it
would be indecorous in the law to meddle with greatness,
even when it is impertinent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La-w me!” exclaims an old lady, who has upset the
contents of her frying-pan into the fire. But the poor soul
little knows the calamity she invokes. It is doubtful
whether fire and frying-pan would not follow, if her request
were complied with. The law being at times both expensive
and speedy.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Characteristics of Literature. Illustrated by the Genius of
Distinguished Men. By Henry T. Tuckerman. Phila.:
Lindsay &amp; Blakiston. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Tuckerman has written many interesting books, but
we think the present volume is his most attractive if not
his best production. It is characterized by his usual refinement
of analysis, wealth of illustration, felicity of allusion,
and mellow richness of style, while in the range it
evinces over widely varied provinces of thought and character,
it indicates more versatility than any of his other
compositions. The volume includes a discussion and
representation of eleven departments of literature, through
a searching examination of as many authors, each of whom
is taken as the exponent of a class. Thus Channing
stands for the Moralist, Sir Thomas Browne for the Philosopher,
Swift for the Wit, Shenstone for the Dillettante,
Charles Lamb for the Humorist, and Macaulay for the
Historian. The selection of men to illustrate the subjects
is, of course, not free from cavil. We should say that
Burke was not exactly the man to stand as an expression
of the Rhetorician, for his rhetoric, though matchless of
its kind, is secondary to his philosophy. He appears to
us, even as analyzed by Mr. Tuckerman, in the character
of a profound, vigorous and vital thinker, and is no more
a rhetorician, in any exclusive sense of the term, than
Bacon, Hooker, Taylor, or even Milton. Where style is
the <span class='it'>incarnation</span> of thought, the visible image of the mind
that employs it—and this is its nature in all the greatest
authors—the word rhetoric is hardly applicable to it.
Macaulay is more emphatically the rhetorician than
Burke.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Select Comedies; Translated from the Italian of Goldoni,
Giraud and Nota. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A volume like the present, giving the English reader
a good idea of the spirit and form of Italian comedy, has
long been wanted, and we have little doubt that it will be
successful. To the lover of the English drama the plays
may seem to lack solid character and unctuous humor;
but they are still distinguished by a fertility in the invention
of ludicrous incidents and positions, and a mischievous
quick-footed spirit of intrigue, that no person with a sense
of the comic can read them without exhilaration. The
translations are, we believe, from an American pen, and
appear to be well executed. Six complete comedies are
given, and the translator has been fortunate in his selections
both in respect to merit and variety. The two
comedies of Goldoni are alone richly worth the price of
the book.</p>

of Jonathan Romer. Edited by W. S. Mayo,
M. D. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is something strange for a writer to present himself
for the first time as a candidate for public favor with a
volume indicating so much power and originality of mind,
and such practiced talents of composition as the present.
The book is a regular tale of adventures, as interesting as
exciting incidents racily told can make it, and inweaved
with the story are many graphic descriptions of scenery
and keen delineations of character. Considered in respect
to the originality of its conception, the new vein of
romance it opens, and the admirable method of the narration,
we think the volume cannot fail to attract the
attention which it will certainly reward.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Earth and Man: Lectures on Comparative Physical
Geography, in its Relation to the History of Mankind.
By Arnold Guyot. Boston: Gould, Kendall &amp; Lincoln.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this valuable Manual is Professor of
Physical Geography and History in the same institution
to which Agassiz is attached, and originally delivered the
present lectures in French to an audience in Boston. They
have been elegantly translated by Professor Felton, of
Harvard University, and are very warmly recommended
by the New England Savans for their union of profundity
and simplicity. The subject is one of the most important
in the whole range of science, and is one in which all can
take an interest, and all obtain information, as popularized
by Professor Guyot. Agassiz says of the book and its
author: “Having been his friend from childhood, as a
fellow student in college, and as colleague in the same
university, I may be permitted to express my high sense
of the value of his attainments. Mr. Guyot has not only
been in the best school, that of Ritter and Humboldt, and
become familiar with the present state of the science of
our earth, but he has himself in many instances drawn
new conclusions from the facts now ascertained, and presented
most of them in a new point of view. Several of
the most brilliant generalizations developed in his lectures,
are his; and if more extensively circulated, will not only
render the study of geography more attractive, but actually
show it in its true light, namely, as the science of
the relations which exist between nature and man,
throughout history.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Life of Maximilien Robespierre. With Extracts from
his Unpublished Correspondence. By G. H. Lewes.
Phila.: Casey &amp; Hart. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this biography is but little known in this
country, and has hardly received his deserts from the
critics on either side of the water. He is a clear, close,
vigorous thinker, an accomplished scholar, and a nervous,
condensed and brilliant, though slightly aphoristic writer.
Though his ideas and style occasionally betray the <a id='inin'></a>influence
of Carlyle, and though his English nature has
been a little modified by an infusion of French metaphysics,
he generally appears as an independent as well as a forcible
thinker. In the present volume, though he appears largely
indebted to the works of Lamartine, Michelet, and Louis
Blanc, he has still produced a book original in the main,
and has been especially happy in steering a middle course
between those writers who have represented Robespierre
as a monstrosity of malignity and cruelty, and those who
have tried hard to make him appear a persecuted and
virtuous patriot, whose most questionable acts sprung
from exalted motives. The reader closes the book with
the feeling that he has gained a better insight into the
character of the immortally infamous revolutionary leader
than he had before. The letters of Robespierre, which
the author obtained in MS. from Louis Blanc, and the
extracts from his speeches in the Convention, add much
to the interest and value of the volume.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>History of Maria Antoinette. By John S. C. Abbott. With
Engravings. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is another of Mr. Abbott’s beautiful series of pocket
histories, having for its subject a story so exciting and so
mournful that the novelist or dramatist could hardly treat
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
its incidents with more pathetic effect than the chronicler
who confines himself to the literal facts. The characteristic
merit of Mr. Abbott’s books is the knowledge they
display not merely of their subjects but of the exact nature
of the ignorance of the general class of readers, and this
merit is well illustrated in the present volume. The
French Revolution is to most minds a confused mass of
terrible events without any connecting principles; but
few can read its history, as far as it is presented in Mr.
Abbott’s simple and orderly narrative, without obtaining
clearer ideas of the whole matter.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A History of American Baptist Missions in Asia, Africa,
Europe and North America. By William <a id='gamm'></a>Gammell, A. M.,
Professor in Brown University. Boston: Gould, Kendall
&amp; Lincoln. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We like the present volume for the indication it gives
of the rich materials for history and biography which lie
almost unused in the various records of Christian missions.
All the heroic qualities developed in man and woman by
religious principles and religious passions, are visible in
those records to the initiated eye, but they are commonly
so submerged in the affected phraseology and sectarian
jargon of mediocre compilers, that they are commonly set
aside as vulgar and fanatical by the general reader. Professor
Gammell has written a volume in which all the
worn and wasted terms of the pedants of cant are discarded,
and the subject, as far as the Baptist missions are
concerned, is treated in a style intelligible to all who have
any perception of beauty, holiness or heroism. The work,
apart from its theological character, is one of great interest
and excellence.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Sacred Rhetoric; or Composition and Delivery of Sermons.
By Henry J. Ripley. Boston: Gould, Kendall &amp; Lincoln.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This treatise should be carefully pondered by all clergymen
who have a contempt for the graces and proprieties
of composition, arising from their apprehension of being
interesting to their congregations. Professor Ripley has
produced a searching treatise, in which, with a true critical
remorselessness, he lays bare the defects of arrangement
and composition most likely to beset the productions of his
profession, and gives a clear statement of those principles
which should guide the brain and pen of the preacher.
The volume also includes Dr. Ware’s admirable “Hints
on Extemporaneous Preaching.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>History of Wonderful Inventions. Illustrated with numerous
Engravings on Wood. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The publishers of this elegantly printed volume have included
it in a series called the Boy’s Own Library, but its
interest and value are hardly confined to youth. It is a
book containing carefully written accounts of the invention
of the Mariner’s Compass, Gunpowder, Clocks, Printing,
the Telescope and Microscope, the Steam-Engine,
the Electric Telegraph, and many other wonderful events
in the history of the intellect. We never read a volume
of this sort without giving a new and vivid impression of
the grandeur of human nature, considered as possessing
the powers of creation and combination.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Green, of Brown University, is the American
editor of this valuable manual, and his name is a guarantee
that it has been revised and corrected with scrupulous
care. To the general student of history the volume will
be of great service, as it maps out the whole ground of
historical study, gives the names of the authorities for the
history of each nation, and in the smallest possible space
consistent with dearness, presents a view of the history,
geography, religion, literature and art of all the ancient
nations, European and Asiatic. The work indicates an
erudition as minute as it is vast.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Spy, a Tale of the Neutral Ground. By the Author of
The Pilot. New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Longevity is no characteristic of novels, and Old Parr
is the last name which could be applied to a hero of fiction.
The romances which flare in the parlors of one year are
pretty sure to repose in the cemeteries of the next. To
this empirical law, Cooper’s Spy is one of the honorable
exceptions. It at once attained popularity, and it has
kept it, surviving all those mutations of the public taste
which, since its first appearance, have consigned so many
brilliant fictions to oblivion. As an old friend in a new
dress, we welcome this volume. Its value is enhanced
by the revision of the author, and the addition of an introduction
and notes.</p>

Curzon. New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this volume is careful to write himself
down an “honorable” on his title page, and the whole
tone of the composition evidences that self-satisfaction
which is so apt to accompany social position. Though the
reader is inclined to be prejudiced against an amateur
author who assumes so confident a tone, the feeling wears
away as he reads the volume. It contains a great deal of
information pleasantly told, has some capital sketches of
curious character, and ranks among the sprightliest of
recent books of travels. The American edition is illustrated
by numerous wood-cuts.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This delightful work forms the tenth volume of the
revised edition of Irving’s works, and has for its subject
a theme especially interesting at the present time, when
more than ever, “westward the course of empire takes its
way.” We hardly know of a more felicitous partnership
than that of Bonneville and Irving—one to perform the
deeds of adventure which the other records.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this volume died at an early age, but not
before he had partly fulfilled the destiny to which his
talents and adventurous spirit pointed. “His adventures
in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains,” and the present

a traveler, but much felicity in transferring to other minds

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
